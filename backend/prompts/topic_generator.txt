You are tasked with generating relevant subtopics for a given overarching topic to create a knowledge graph. Follow these instructions carefully:

1. Carefully analyze the overarching topic. Consider various aspects, applications, theories, and related concepts within the field.

2. Generate 12-15 relevant subtopics that are directly related to the overarching topic. These subtopics should:
   a) Cover different facets of the main topic
   b) Be specific enough to be meaningful, but broad enough to potentially have their own subtopics
   c) Be diverse, covering theoretical, practical, historical, and future-oriented aspects where applicable

3. Ensure that your list of subtopics covers all possible facets of the overarching topic, including but not limited to:
   - Fundamental concepts and theories
   - Current applications and use cases (along with technicals!)
   - Emerging trends and future directions
   - Related technologies or methodologies
   - Ethical considerations and societal impacts
   - Challenges and limitations
   - Interdisciplinary connections

For example, a good set of subtopics for "XGBoost" could include some of the following topics:
   - Gradient boosting framework
   - Decision tree ensembles
   - Feature importance in XGBoost
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Handling missing values
   - Regularization techniques
   - Cross-validation strategies
   - XGBoost for classification
   - XGBoost for regression
   - Scalability and performance optimization
   - Distributed XGBoost
   - XGBoost Implementationsin Python
   - GPU acceleration in XGBoost
   - Early stopping and model evaluation
   - XGBoost for time series analysis
   - Interpretability of XGBoost models
   - XGBoost in production environments

4. After generating your list, review it to ensure diversity and comprehensiveness. Then, provide your final output of 12-15 subtopics within the specified tags. Also, give a good brief name for the resulting knowledge graph.

Remember, your goal is to create a well-rounded and informative set of subtopics that could form the basis of a knowledge graph for the given overarching topic.
The overarching topic you will be working with is:
