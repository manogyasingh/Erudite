      "content": "# Asset Price Prediction Techniques: A Comprehensive Overview\n\nPredicting asset prices is a complex endeavor with significant implications for investors, traders, and policymakers.  This article explores various techniques employed for this purpose, ranging from classical statistical methods to advanced machine learning approaches.  While perfect prediction remains elusive, understanding the strengths and limitations of each technique is crucial for informed decision-making.\n\n\n## I. Classical Statistical Methods\n\nTraditional approaches often rely on time series analysis, leveraging the temporal dependencies inherent in asset price data.  These methods include:\n\n* **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models:** ARIMA models capture the autocorrelations within a time series to forecast future values. They are relatively simple to implement but may struggle with non-linear relationships and structural breaks in the data.  Several studies have used ARIMA models for stock price prediction, with varying degrees of success [S80, S81].\n\n* **Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models:** GARCH models are specifically designed to capture the volatility clustering often observed in financial markets. They model the conditional variance of the price changes, providing insights into risk assessment and portfolio management.  Research has shown the usefulness of GARCH models in analyzing the impact of exchange rate volatility on stock market fluctuations [S81].\n\n* **ARCH (Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) models:**  A simpler variant of GARCH, ARCH models also focus on volatility but with a more parsimonious structure.  These can be effective in capturing certain volatility patterns, though their accuracy might be limited in highly volatile markets [S81].\n\nThese classical methods form the foundation of many financial models but often lack the flexibility to handle complex, non-linear relationships present in real-world market data.  [[Portfolio Volatility Estimation]] is directly related to the application and limitations of these methods.\n\n\n## II. Machine Learning Techniques\n\nThe limitations of classical methods have spurred significant interest in machine learning (ML) for asset price prediction.  Various ML algorithms have been applied, including:\n\n* **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** SVMs are powerful algorithms effective in high-dimensional spaces. They have been used for both asset price prediction and portfolio optimization, demonstrating accuracy advantages over some other techniques [S57].\n\n* **Random Forest (RF):** RF is an ensemble method combining multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and robustness. Studies have shown RF to be highly effective in predicting gold and silver prices, outperforming simpler models like linear regression [S53, S63].\n\n* **K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):**  k-NN is a non-parametric method classifying data points based on their proximity to known data.  It's shown promise in silver price prediction, especially for longer-term forecasts [S63].\n\n* **Neural Networks:**  Various neural network architectures have demonstrated superior performance in numerous domains, including finance.  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) networks, excel at capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data. Several studies highlighted the strengths of LSTM and GRU for stock price prediction, mutual fund price prediction, and Bitcoin price prediction [S55, S59, S61, S75, S80].  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), typically used in image processing, have also been applied to financial time series data after transforming it into a 2D image representation [S69, S70].  Transformer networks, initially developed for natural language processing, are also increasingly used for financial time series data, showing promising results for predicting both asset price and direction [S67, S69].\n\nThe choice of ML algorithm depends on the specific dataset, desired prediction horizon, and computational resources.  The accuracy of ML models heavily relies on the quality and quantity of data.  [[Machine Learning Integration with HMMs]] explores ways to improve the efficacy of these models.\n\n\n## III. Hybrid Models and Advanced Techniques\n\nRecent research focuses on combining the strengths of different methods, creating hybrid models that integrate classical time series analysis with ML techniques. For instance, researchers have combined ARIMA with neural networks to exploit both the linear and non-linear relationships in the data [S80, S81].\n\n\n## IV.  Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in Finance\n\nHidden Markov Models (HMMs) offer a powerful framework for modeling asset prices by incorporating regime-switching behavior.  They assume that the market operates in different states (regimes), each characterized by a distinct statistical distribution. These states are \"hidden,\" and the model aims to infer them from observable data (e.g., price series).\n\nHMMs are particularly well-suited for:\n\n* **Market state detection and regime switching:** Identifying periods of bull and bear markets, allowing for dynamic risk management and investment strategies [[Market State Detection and Regime Switching]].\n\n* **Financial market state inference:**  Inferring underlying market conditions that may not be directly observable from prices alone [[Financial Market State Inference]].\n\n* **Probabilistic forecasting methods:**  Providing probability distributions over future asset prices, rather than just point estimates [[Probabilistic Forecasting Methods]].\n\nHowever, the success of HMMs depends on accurate estimation of the model parameters, including Markov transition probabilities [[Markov Transition Probability Estimation]].  This can be computationally challenging, especially with high-dimensional data [[Computational Challenges in Financial HMMs]].  Bayesian inference techniques [[Bayesian Inference in Market Modeling]] are often employed to address these challenges.  There are also [[Limitations and Assumptions of HMM in Finance]] that need to be considered carefully.  A deep understanding of [[Fundamental Principles of Hidden Markov Models]] is crucial for employing this technique effectively.\n\n\n## V.  Sentiment Analysis and Alternative Data Sources\n\nIncorporating alternative data sources, such as news sentiment, social media trends, and economic indicators, can enhance the accuracy of asset price predictions. Sentiment analysis techniques, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP), gauge the overall tone and opinion expressed in textual data, offering valuable insights into market sentiment and investor psychology.  Studies explored the use of sentiment analysis to improve stock price prediction models [S65].\n\n\n## VI. High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Applications\n\nHFT relies on extremely fast execution speeds to exploit tiny price discrepancies.  Sophisticated models are developed to make very short-term predictions, necessitating high-frequency data and robust algorithms.  [[High-Frequency Trading Applications]] highlight both the potential and risks associated with this field.\n\n\n## VII.  Risk Management Modeling\n\nAccurate asset price prediction is essential for effective risk management. Models are designed to quantify and mitigate potential losses, incorporating uncertainty and volatility.  [[Risk Management Modeling]] details the various methods used in this critical area.\n\n\n## VIII. Algorithmic Trading Strategies\n\nMany algorithmic trading strategies rely on accurate asset price predictions to automate buying and selling decisions, optimizing portfolios and maximizing returns.  However, these strategies must account for market volatility, transaction costs, and risk. [[Algorithmic Trading Strategies]] discusses these strategies in greater detail.\n\n\n## IX. Conclusion and Future Directions\n\nAsset price prediction is an active area of research, with significant advancements using machine learning and advanced statistical methods.  While perfect prediction is unlikely, combining various techniques, incorporating alternative data sources, and understanding the limitations of each approach remains crucial.  Future research should focus on:\n\n* Developing more robust and interpretable models that can handle non-linearity, volatility clustering, and structural breaks in financial data.\n\n* Integrating diverse data sources (fundamental, technical, alternative) to capture a more comprehensive view of market dynamics.\n\n* Improving the efficiency and scalability of prediction models for high-frequency trading applications.\n\n* Developing more effective risk management strategies based on improved price predictions.\n\n* Addressing ethical considerations and potential market manipulation resulting from algorithmic trading based on advanced prediction models.\n\n\nThe ongoing evolution of this field is poised to reshape financial markets and investment strategies.  Further research into the technical intricacies of [[Time Series Pattern Recognition]] will continue to refine the accuracy and reliability of asset price prediction.\n",

this guys if you're looking for some Alpha projects I'll leave a couple of links in the description for some pre-sales that are doing really really well here you should definitely go check out Pepe Unchained it's a layer 2 based protocol it's basically going to be um pumped off fun but for ethereum great [31.72s] utility they've raised 73 million go check that out and also guys crypto All Stars it's the first ever meme Vault um where you can basically stake Your Meme portfolio and earn passive income throughout that and if you look at how memes are behaving recently this thing is destined for success and they've already raised $8.6 million in this sale as well so go check out those projects guys I'll leave the links in the description now back to the salana okay a market cap $12.78 billion here not really seen that much movement here over the last day as [62.52s] I said sideways action is sort of prevailing right now with a with a current move of around 0.21% so nothing too crazy let's have a little look at the 7day together again just like I said 0.57% over the last 7 days so not even a percent gain or a percent loss here so that's pretty crazy considering this market and considering the ranking of this asset right now let's have a look at the monthly this is definitely going to be a lot more you can see 4 6.69% over the last month and you can [92.88s] see just by this chart this has been consolidating for quite a while and we're definitely due another leg up might even be seeing a breakout scenario for this asset so let's go over to the chart and really dive into a bit more detail um as to what could be happening here in the next sort of couple of weeks couple of months here for salana and guys if you do like salana make sure you drop a comment in the um in the comment section because I'm dying to know what price you bought salana at or whether you you think salana is going to be going up or down whether your bullish or your bearish okay so let's jump to the [124.24s] macro here on the daily and really start to dissect this uh together here so I'm going to get rid of the volume Wast ATR bands I know they're really good but it's a bit polluting on the chart right now because I want to make this as simple as possible for the newer Traders out there because we are accommodating some new people guys because we're getting retail retail is coming back to crypto bitcoin's at 100K so it's looking really really really good here so let's simplify this down and let's um get rid of all this uh all this noise noise so it's easy to understand For You noer Traders out there now we were looking at [154.96s] this channel guys okay this is a a falling Channel and they tend to usually break to the upside we did see quite an aggressive move aggressive break to the upside from this point claiming all moving averages here and um currently holding support really quite nicely in these areas we are currently testing the 21 EMA the 7 EMA and also the price action Channel absolutely fine to be doing this because obviously we saw um a pump of literally like 43% but what what can we expect here very likely that we find support and see [186.80s] another wave up for around 10% what I'm looking for here guys is a solid candle body close on The Daily on the macro here at this current level if we can close at 237 here um on The Daily on the macro then um it's a very very nice position that you can be entering here because you can see we're bouncing off the price action Channel you can see we've also got a lovely level of support here that we have tested um in this area reclaimed it if we don't lose that here in the next 12 hours and 57 minutes it's basically a straight Moon shot for [217.56s] around 10% bitcoin's also reclaimed well also claimed you said reclaimed alltime High it has reclaimed alltime high and set a new alltime high of $100,000 which will give um leading layer one blockchains like salana like ethereum like avac another potential uh bit of bullish momentum to the upside which is very very likely that we are going to see that here especially for salana being the leader in the mean coin pack okay so yeah looking pretty good let me know what you think of that position and um salana in general and remember guys [248.92s] if you are looking for new Alpha projects go go check out Pepe unchain they've raised $73 million they're launching in 7 Days time and also crypto Allstars launching in 15 days and they have raised $8.6 million two really good projects there guys um and they're my they're basically my next 10 to 100x picks let me know what you think in the comment section of this video if you found any value here drop a little like love to see it and if you are new to the channel make sure you hit the Subscribe button notification Bell on and you're never going to miss one of our uploads [279.20s] thank you ever so much for watching guys have a fantastic day hopefully salana is going to be bullish that's going to be it for me peace out for now and I'll see you in the next one",

I'm not really sure how to start this one I know I say that quite often it's usually because it's true uh this isn't this is not meant to be and I told you so so much more as um stop letting other people dictate [30.52s] what you're doing and what you should be in and just kind of I don't want to use the term follow your heart that's way too cheesy but you you understand what I'm saying a number of years ago I mean many years ago when I got into the cryptocurrency space people told me often what exactly what I should buy what I should be looking at and none of them were ever actually correct when I say the term or the phrase uh do your own research it it you know it entails a number of things look at what the coin [61.76s] is what the project is the company who's behind it who's standing to the side of it who created it what's the allocation what's the previous all-time high like what usage does it have like what are the current applications for it um and I think this goes all over a lot of people's heads because they don't want to do it I find it incredibly odd that people don't want to read which is a very big problem uh amongst people a [92.28s] lot of people will see a headline and they'll screenshot and share that someone just got chills because you do it and they'll share that headline with their friends and it kind of spreads a whole bunch of nonsense all over the place recently um rul pal who's a very large figurehead within the cryptocurrency space Also even came forward and like as far as I understand from the article that I read um actually came forward and like apologized to [122.36s] people within the xrp community there's been so much hate about this project over multiple years and I could never really figure out why I think it was always kind of like cool to like hate against Ripple the company Andor xrp a lot of people who also didn't like Gary Gensler Gary Gensler is his name there we go Gary Gensler also like sided with him as far as like his hate for ripple and subsequently also xrp the coin this coin and this project and the [155.92s] people behind Ripple have done I mean like really amazing things part of the research that should have been done especially with all these brand new coins coming out is like the actual the words not fortitude but like the strength of this project what they've been doing we've had news for years that the people from Ripple have been in discussions with governments for a long time the initial wave of people who [186.00s] fully understood or at least partially understood what was going on was when we heard that Ripple was working with the fed and then we heard that Ripple was I believe working with the European Central Bank and having discussions with them as Ripple SL xrp are meant to kind of work with the system as I stated in another video this was terrifying years ago because no one wanted Bitcoin to work with the system and now Bitcoin basically is the system the system is also buying up tons of Bitcoin so [216.96s] therefore that conversation has been completely squashed because we know exactly what's going on with Bitcoin and also the us in the future buying up Bitcoin between the institutional support between the governments and central banks buying up xrp as well we've had news a lot of times and a lot of times it's used as fear-mongering as far as um every month the company Ripple has an automatic they're not doing it themselves there's an automatic [247.84s] unlocking of 1 billion xrp in their reserves that they use for whatever they need for the company if they're if they're throwing a a conference or whatever the company needs it for it's their money A lot of times they sell these coins and the issue ends up being in the title someone will write Ripple just sold 200 million coins so the people who are outside who refuse to read and over these years have let themselves be lied to they hear that and [278.24s] they assume that the company Ripple is sending these 200 million xrp to a crypto exchange to sell them you know what actually is going on and I'm pretty sure someone who knows like fragments about xrp and ripple can can definitely answer it these coins are getting sold to banks these coins are getting sold to institutions like that's the actual selling that's going on however over the course of a multi-year period where the pric is and moving and no one's reading [309.48s] any articles or trying to gather any extra information when you read the articles people in the xrp space understand and they get the news those coins went to a brand new activated wallet as we're hearing that banks in Japan and around Asia and in the Middle East are partnering with ripple we understand that the that sale is going to a country it's going to a central bank so to make a gigantically long [340.16s] story short a lot of people are now understanding what this is and it's always a shame that people only get it when prices go up or when prices are too high for them to accumulate as much as they could have had before and that's also part of the topic of this video even where xrp is right now currently as I'm making this video in price a lot of people think that we are nowhere [370.88s] near where this coin is going to go there's a lot of speculation that within the first three months of 2025 that this coin is going to a see new heights but also B and I hate the term face melting and I'm not sure why people use face melting for Price predictions so often but it's definitely there as far as I understand from the [401.60s] news and articles that I've been reading the uh what's the term uh the ceiling not the ceiling the resistance the resistance for xrp was apparently around 94 cents I think I saw something about a115 and somewhere else around there once these numbers got broken through that was kind of it there's no more real resistance for this coin Ripple is [432.92s] planning on going public sometime in 2025 we have had news that there are now filings for XR PFS in the US OFA the rumors are that Gary Gensler is leaving the head of the SEC that the next head of the SEC as far as we know is going to be more crypto-friendly and actually give regulations and will allow more altcoin ETFs to go through if this ETF goes through and we hear that there's [464.12s] billions of dollars pouring into xrp daily this is going to cause the price to rise a lot higher speculation has been abound obviously about when this coin is going to hit $10 $10 for xrp is essentially bitcoin's 100,000 it's like this level that everyone's kind of waiting for it to go past to kind of you know stick your tongue out at people and go see I told you so but a lot of the I told you so has been coming over the [494.48s] last few years when we saw these Partnerships when we saw this building when we saw this integration when we got the news from the central banks who are building their currencies and their stable coins on top of the xrp blockchain that was kind of the solidification for me so estimates that we've had before for xrp over the course of the 2025 Bull Run have ranged anywhere from $7 to like $12 that's usually been the numbers that people say because once again people are [524.76s] waiting for that breakthrough of the $10 psychological level however there's a very popular Trader within the space his name is Peter Brandt b r n DT and he said part of the issue is is that once xrp broke by the resistance level of 92 cents and rushed upward it kind of let us into another space where the coin is just going to continue having constant breakthroughs and breakouts in price [555.00s] this man assumes that xrp in 2025 is going as high as $24 per coin I personally have had expectations of between $ 13 to $15 it seemed the most likely anything above that is kind of like wow look at it go but it's similar for Bitcoin as I've said I think we're going to hit 200 250k seems believable if we go to 300 or [585.64s] 400 I'm not going to go Bitcoin can't do that it would also seem completely believable as well the thing is is that xrp much like BTC is incredibly fine night there is no more xrp being made and what is there is what is there even more so that's also a lie because over the course of me talking to you in this video xrp has been burned as xrp transactions take place xrp gets burned in the background [616.68s] therefore decreasing the supply it is an Ever decreasing coin so Peter brand believes that we are going to see xrp go as high as $24 per coin over essentially over the course of the next 11 months there's nothing in my mind that tells me that we can't or that we won't it's just a matter of let's kind of wait and see there have been so many crypto projects last thought within the space that I knew would do [647.24s] exceptionally well and you've seen me talking about them or going over them or even the news that's also been a very very very big Catalyst a lot of times I see people in the comment section say why aren't you talking about this coin",

virtual Forex on this video guys listen I appreciate all of the love help the Channel's been developing insane I need to take some time to genuinely teach you on this I was laying in bed ultimate nighttime for hours I could not sleep and I turned into seeking to suppose how I could better provide an explanation for important Bank virtual currency and how much of an effect it really is going to have on xrp's price listen I'm going to try to throw it to you in this video what Mar is doing is sincerely [31.04s] that it's trying to the destiny so it envisions a future Kingdom of the Arena wherein important banks have issued principal financial institution digital currencies after which ask a totally easy question of ways you can virtually convert from one currency to the opposite how do you do that well here we borrow from decentralized Finance or Defi and so in defi when you need to move from one coin to some other coin you often use something referred to as an automated Marketplace maker and what we're looking to do in Project Mariana is to copy this concept in a world with cbdc so we are basic trying to construct an automated [61.44s] Marketplace maker for crucial Bank digital currencies and optimistically which can then assist speed up and make go border bills less expensive who has got the fining class generation for amson for primary Bank virtual foreign money I'll assist you to solution that to yourself also check this out so poo used to be I think an American colony I'm now not a history buff so don't shoot me but I realize they use green BS in poo and I in my opinion assume that before you'll see a significant financial institution virtual Forex inside the US they might need to check it on a smaller body of human human beings that's no longer the right way to say that they need to test it on a [94.16s] smaller population there we move all proper and so the Palo cbdc for us greenbacks in Palo is truly turning into honestly famous a lot of humans are starting to apply and I assume this may be a catalyst for other US dollar kind cbdcs which might be constructed out maybe inside the US so Ripple is conducting a cbdc pilot with palao Ripple's partnership with the palawa ship with the Pala Island Kingdom pal Ripple undertaking a cbdc BDC pilot with Pala they said that three instances awesome the National Bank of Georgia which is called the NB is called the nbg [124.80s] has selected Ripple as his technical associate for the digital AR assignment this partnership brings a digital AR pilot to existence the usage of Ripple cbdc platform Hong Kong cbdc Pilots programmability tokenization Atomic settlement right we are speaking about some of the biggest banks within the world here working with ripple Labs you have fubon bank right here you have got MasterCard that's additionally on this simply you look at the caliber of humans and institutions which are partnering to make all of these items man EST and you really see that Ripple has the keys to the kingdom to get all these items achieved you additionally [155.16s] have Banker Republic right here we are excited to announce that P system Ripple will start running with the Central Bank of Columbia on their vital Bank digital currency as well and then you definitely even have a shay berer said that Ripple is actively assembly in discussing relevant Banks virtual techniques with several special Nations but it gets better than this proper the senior Vice chairman for crucial Bank virtual currency Anthony welfare has already stated Ripple is operating with up to 20 critical banks around the sector and a lot of those have not been introduced yet here is what Ripple is operating on with fubon bank and this leads into form [185.20s] of what we're speaking approximately right here let me show you this as a part of the eh KD pilot program fubon Bank Ripple and partners have spent months growing a quicker Mana to unlock domestic equity and flip it into credit through a home fairness line of credit score loan or HELOC loan your loan is wanted the credit score right away seems as hypothetical KD minted securely through fubon bank using the Ripple cbdc platform that's so the Ripple cbdc platform is likewise being used to tokenize secondary mortgagees helux right imagine what is going to appear after you begin to cross get a regular mortgage and as opposed to waiting all [216.28s] that point proper if you have ever had to shop for a house you understand it takes time you need to cross get accredited which can take a few weeks then you need to move put the provider at the house it ought to take a completely longterm with cryptocurrency especially xrp and this Ripple platform you can without a doubt do it instantly that's simply honestly amazing also huge development Ripple CBC platform homec com right we just talked about this this is what it sort of seems like you have over here Ripple cbdc this is kind of how the loan procedure Works however you have xrp and ripple Generation all evolved on this also you have Ripple swell 20202 with MasterCard [248.16s] the monetary industry desires to come on board let me play this for you 45 seconds you've been very vocal about you believe you studied that is as transformative crypto as the internet turned into in the late ' 90s when it first came into being the net become a dispens community that permits people to transmit information and blockchain is a dispense Network that permits people to shop and switch possession assets I have the conviction for that Vision to comprehend itself the economic Enterprise wishes to come back on board they changed into no other way there was no different way for blockchain and these Enterprise models to head mainstream without the economic [279.48s] industry they're coming infant they're coming right you also Georgia and its Partnerships with ripple in this for CBC assignment and its efforts for the destiny and the crypto Hub let me play this for you we began cbdc assignment in addition to nevertheless on the very preliminary stage however we're like glad to announce that we invited well-known Ripple organization who helped us with the pilot stage additionally may be Advanced I need to just take a step back and say like you already know in case you study your vision let's assume 5 years from now right if you could do cart blanch with something coverage you want what is the effect that [311.24s] Georgia what are the results which you desire the Georgia has in 5 years time just kind of actually listening to your imaginative impression for the US OFA and for n for nbg it will no longer be like correct from my facet because I'm a regulator to begin with simply to have a few quantitative quantitative shall we Embrace assumptions but I would love to peer Georgia greater Superior in terms of becoming a center coridor inch Hub we are constructing physical infrastructure through Georg Georgia we are already a hub for Logistics through our ports we are serving flows of power critical pipeline [342.08s] tasks Black Sea submarine energy cable Telecom Industries there additionally I think that we've um all physical infrastructure projects in vicinity in order to grow to be a terrific basis for similarly monetary services that could be constructed on them we have quite flexible and friendly law already and we're Flex ible once more we are ready to modify tonight Sumit toward wishes of the industry I would love to look extra traders in the marketplace because we nevertheless have a quite shallow shallow Capital Market on this turns okay so Georgia is making an attempt to revitalize their entire [372.68s] Financial system and they may be the use of Ripple cbdc generation to to convey themselves into the 21st century Ripple hits some other Milestone with the Countrywide Bank of Georgia right look at those connections you have palao Hong Kong Manitoba you've got Montenegro that is the Euro Colombia Bhutan Georgia uh these are simply those we recn about imagine the opposite 15 that we do not men it's going to be pretty insane right as price from the actual Global dollars actions digitally that value is going to start residing and building at The xrp Ledger if you bring over $1 trillion globally from special currencies on The [403.52s] xrp Ledger that's still every other trillion dollars that is going to increase the fee of xrp Ripple companions with New Zealand Federal Reserve to for the Advent of a cbdc pilot with pilot we mentioned Bhutan already proper Ripple is genuinely just the iceberg on the top here right you have all of those different organizations Economic Institutions you understand IMF you've got the bi it's all here and they may be all running with ripple and xrp and just examine the banks right here look on the listing of banks all of those distinct Banks can are available in and start operating [434.64s] with Ripple's imperative financial institution virtual Forex technology they can come in and start working much like fubon Bank did proper if someone of these Banks wanted to create their own type of HELOC system with the cbdc technology that Ripple has they may all do the equal component that they did with fullon bank right also consider solid coin technology all of those special banks are going to want to create their very own strong coin over the years and it really is only only a recipe for massive success on The xrp Ledger also MasterCard is shaped to cbdc companion application with ripple and consensus so men Ripple is at the [465.20s] Forefront of all of these things it virtually goes to send xrp to a whole new excessive as all of this money comes on chain right it in reality is going to catapult xrp and ripple to a whole new category of degree and this is what I'm looking forward to as an xrp investor I am retaining on for the money proper now we are just gambling",

returns and risk relative to other asset classes all fiduciaries have to look at this new asset class and uh and so we think it could become you know two to five or 6% [30.92s] of portfolios uh it's also an insurance policy in Emerging Markets renowned hedge fund manager and star stock picker Kathy Wood has always been pro-innovation and what it could mean for the growth of the US economy in the coming years in various interviews and social media posts Cathy has repeatedly shared beliefs that we are about to witness a radical shift in the global economy driven by the rapid advancements in five disruptive Innovations platforms [61.32s] artificial intelligence blockchain Technology robotics genomic sequencing and energy storage she Likens the convergence of these Technologies to the Revolutionary impact of the telephone electricity and internal combustion engine in the early 1900s however she contends that this new wave of innovation will produce an even more dramatic economic shift while those earlier Technologies spurred a five-fold increase in real G GDP growth Cathy [91.44s] predicts that these five platforms will generate an unprecedented economic boom current projections by economists suggest a Slowdown in global growth to around 2.6% down from the historical average of 3% over the past Century however Cathy's research paints a far more optimistic picture forecasting an extraordinary 8.5% growth rate even under conservative scenarios she strongly believes this boom will be driven by the convergence [121.68s] of these platforms which currently make up $19 trillion of the global Equity market cap she believes they will rise to an astonishing $220 trillion within 6 years with the historic victory of president-elect Donald Trump Cathy says these platforms have finally found the extra push they need to take off completely Cathy believes blockchain technology and other disruptive Technologies could grow swiftly under a Donald Trump Administration stating that Federal deregulation a known Hallmark of [152.60s] trump could drive innovation in one of her videos published just before the election The Arc invest founder and CIO said if Trump's elected and they do the decreasing regulation getting government spending down and expectations of government spending down I believe that what we've been expecting is going to happen on steroids and that is the five major Innovation platforms that are evolving today so robotics energy storage artificial intelligence blockchain technology and multiomic [183.56s] sequencing she reiterates these claims in the latest episode of her monthly in the know with Kathy Wood pointing out just how beneficial she thinks Trump's Administration will be for Innovations and the overall US economy as we bring you clips from Cathy Wood's video please take a little time to like this video subscribe to the channel and turn on post notifications for more videos like this thanks for the support and enjoy the video with election you know before this moment in time I was talking about [214.28s] okay gridlock uh there nothing's going to happen uh now with the results of the election um we can see a lot of changes and I think the biggest one uh and what we just Illustrated with uh nuclear power is regulations getting regulations out of the way um um uh we we obviously need regulations uh for the safety and [246.68s] well-being uh of individuals and so forth and absolutely agree with that but uh the regulatory environment is a morass now I mean when you put people in positions as regulators and they start building their Empires you get more and more regulations and it's it's really had a strangle hold on on businesses especially small and medium businesses so we think those shackles are going to come off we think the biggest regulatory [279.80s] changes are are going to happen because SEC chairman uh gendler is going he's announced he's re he's leaving uh on January 20th uh so the the digital asset world we think is now about to take off and and Thrive uh and then of course while we haven't heard anything about Lon at the Federal Trade Commission which uh that [311.36s] commission has been an obstacle to mergers and Acquisitions during the last four years uh to such an extent that it has really harmed Innovation uh certainly our strategy is an example of that um because you large companies have not felt any pressure competitive or otherwise because of the regular regulatory stance of lenina con and others out there uh to uh investigate [345.28s] new technologies actually buy companies um and establish a a a price these are strategic buys and they Telegraph to the world how much innov is worth from a strategic point of view uh well we haven't seen a lot of that there's been a dir of it and we think that's going to change so we're going to have a lot of price Discovery uh and we know also that uh at the Department of [377.52s] Justice um uh president Trump is bringing in people who are uh very Pro competition uh and they are looking at sort of quazi monopolies out there as as being not so healthy uh for uh growth in the US and and global economy uh so I think we're going to see a lot of freeing up and a lot of m&a there's pent up demand for it uh and we often say [410.96s] that we don't want the companies in our strategies to be taken out uh we think they're pure plays and have miles to go but what we do want is price Discovery out there and we've lacked that for the last four years um another important initiative so important is uh known as Doge uh we mentioned it I think on the last in the no uh so the department of government efficiency headed by Elon [442.68s] Musk and Vic ramaswami um uh we think is is going to be uh extremely important in terms of streamlining businesses and it has been fascinating during the last month or so to watch them evolve their strategy Trump has tapped two business Titans billionaire Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vic ramaswami to head his Department of government efficiency Doge this non-governmental task force will be [473.92s] tasked with finding ways to reduce government spending by cutting programs and slashing federal regulations according to reports Elon and Vic plan to work alongside the White House Office of Management and budget headed by Trump's nominee Russ vout known for masterminding cuts in the past doge is a historic opportunity for structural reductions in the federal government Elon and Vivic wrote in a recent oped in the Wall Street Journal we are prepared for the onslaught Cathy is quite optimistic about these plans but notes [505.92s] that the department will have to work within the confines of the government's current structure initially to avoid encountering significant resistance however she notes they are already creating straightforward initiatives to address the challenges an example is the requirement that employees report to their offices four or 5 days a week Cathy believes this will lead to considerable attrition as many individuals have become accustomed to remote work she also points out the recent reveal by Elon Musk that approximately $500 billion worth of [537.48s] contracts have expired yet spending on them continues resolving this alone could get us a quarter of the way to achieving a $2 trillion reduction in government spending by July 4th 2026 Kathy notes in her video she also discusses bitcoin's recently achieved $100,000 Milestone and what it means for the overall digital asset space here are more clips from the video here is an exciting chart we hit and crossed [567.64s] $100,000 on bitcoin this week um that's a big deal uh uh as as many of you know we've been involved with Bitcoin uh since it was $250 in 2015 when we wrote our first white paper on Bitcoin in collaboration with art laugher and I remember back then saying to Art when he said this is what I have been waiting for since the [598.32s] goldwind window closed in 1971 and I said to him at that point I said I remember Bitcoin was $250 I said art that sounds this sounds like a big idea how big could it be and he said at that time well how big is the US monetary base that's the reserve currency of the world this seems to be the new Reserve currency of the world I said well back then it was four and a half trillion dollars today it's about a little over seven trillion dollar well [630.16s] Crossing $100,000 today took us uh to roughly $2 trillion uh so we're well on our way uh but as we were talking and and of course I I've kept this conversation live with art laugher he has come back to me and he said well wait a minute you know before 2008 the monetary base was $750 billion that's all we needed for the reserve currency back then and what [661.16s] we've gone back to say to Art is yes if we were just looking at it as the world's Reserve currency you might be right um but we're looking at it in many other ways as well uh it's a substitute for gold a store of value gold is a$1 155 trillion asset it is a new asset class or as we named our paper in 20 2016 the one we did in collaboration [692.56s] with coinbase uh ringing the bell for a new asset class how big could that be uh if this new asset class with low correlations of returns and risk relative to other asset classes all fiduciaries have to look at this new asset class and uh and so we think it could become you know two to five or six percent of portfolios uh it's also an insurance [723.76s] policy in emerging markets for populations who are used to whether it's corruption or you know inexperience or what have you in terms of fiscal and monetary policies but you know collapses in currencies and outright",

top for Bitcoin everything from this massive flash crash on bitcoin to the new incoming chairman of the SEC Paul Atkins to the fact that Bitcoin is on its way to flipping gold today I'm going to share with you all the reasons that I can find that Bitcoin is nowhere near done with this bull market at $100,000 and I'm going to share with you exactly why we are still acquiring [31.72s] Bitcoin even at these levels if you enjoy today's video make sure to hit that like button and subscribe to the channel but without much further Ado let's go ahead and Dive Right on into it today's video is brought to

partake in some blof fin rewards here in the war of the Wales I'm about to show you why $1,000 is nowhere near the top for Bitcoin but first we've got to start on coin market cap you see something very [94.24s] interesting has been happening on bitcoin as of late it's actually been losing market dominance to the altcoins on 11:20 2024 bitcoin's market dominance was sitting at 60 right now on December the 6th it's trading at 54 the reason that this is so important and why it ties into Bitcoin going so much higher than $100,000 is because the altcoins are now being enrolled in this bull run Bitcoin after the election went on a massive tear and the altcoins more or less got left behind but in the recent few weeks the altcoins have started to Rally even more ethereum has recently [125.52s] topped $4,000 Solana has recently gone up to almost 270 cardano is hitting a133 and xrp is almost back to three bucks the fact that the altcoins are rallying like this ought to give you the confidence to understand that the altcoin engine is fully in motion we've got a cycle where the altcoins rally while bitcoin's down are trading sideways and then it flips and Bitcoin rallies while the altcoins take a break and we go back and forth and back and forth and while the Bitcoin chart look like this with some ups and downs and the Solana chart may look like this with some ups and downs and the binance chart may look like this with some ups and [156.60s] downs the total cryptocurrency market capitalization chart the aggregate value of the entire crypto Market just continues to March ever higher do you notice how total is starting to look a lot like the S&P 500 individual stocks go up and individual stocks go down but the total market cap chart just like the S&P 500 just like the DJI starts smoothing out we have a very strong bull market in play that's not going to end anytime soon the altcoins are helping to ensure that but let's talk about some [186.92s] other technical reasons why bitcoin's nowhere near done and where might Bitcoin be going well the first thing I want to mention here is that Bitcoin does not hit all-time high right after the election No in fact Bitcoin always takes at least 370 days after the United States presidential election to hit alltime High here in 2012 and 2013 the all-time high was hit $122,000 the all-time high was hit 12,000 higher than Bitcoin was trading at during the election $10 to $1,200 and that happened 378 days later after the 2016 election [217.68s] of President Donald Trump we saw a 399 day rally 2718 here on bitcoin and the bull market lasted about another 400 days after the election the same thing happened here in 2020 Bitcoin rallied for 371 days and rallied 400% after the election occurred so why then especially using the context here why then would the bull market be over right here that's like saying the bull market would have been over for Bitcoin at 20K back in 2020 that's like saying bitcoin's bull market would have been over at $700 back in 2016 that's like saying bitcoin's bull market would [248.04s] have been over at $10 back in 2012 and completely forgetting the rest of these Cycles this rally that we've been witnessing over the last few weeks seems massive from our short-term narrow-minded perspective but when we look on the chart the bottom line is you cannot even see this rally it's tiny both in the amount of time that it's taking place in and the amount of percentage increase that we've seen come from it and that's not the only factor to consider here guys the other thing that we've got to consider is this big flash crash that Bitcoin saw on the 5th [278.08s] of December in my opinion this crash on bitcoin is exceedingly bullish because it allowed the pent up energy of wanting to take profits to be expended from the Bulls that are not actually Bears they're just trying to lock in gains and there's still so much confidence in the market that Bitcoin has almost immediately been able to Rally back from $92,000 all the way up to 100 the speed of this crash denotes that profit was taken in a way that did not actually hurt the Integrity of the bull market but the fact is it still actually happened which actually strengthens the [309.60s] Integrity of the bull market because if you don't have profits taken during a big rally then eventually those profits will be taken and you're going to see a 20 30 40 50% crash which would have been the end of the bull market the fact that we dropped down to 92 bounced almost immediately right back up to 99 shows us that that was just profit taking it wasn't actually the bull market concluding but where my Bitcoin be going from here well you see in the last bull market Bitcoin went to a level called the 3.61 eight Fibonacci extension level you draw Fibonacci extension by drawing Fibonacci retracement from the previous [340.96s] bull Market's all-time high to the bare Market bottom and then when you do that upside down it gives you Fibonacci extension which gives you a price target for the next bull market as you can see we went to 3.61 eight right here Bitcoin rallied up to roughly 63 to $65,000 we actually hit 69 but it's about the same now I do expect somewhat diminishing return turns over the course of this bull market compared to the last bull market considering now we're having to add hundreds of billions of dollars of market capitalization to move just about anywhere but that does not nullify the validity and the efficacy of the Fibonacci extension so while 3618 may be [372.80s] out of the cards 2.61 eight might make more sense and when we draw our Fibonacci extension from the previous all-time high back down to Bare Market bottom at 155 we can see that that would give us a 2.68 Fibonacci extension up at $154,000 the 3618 Fibonacci extension which is where we went during the last bull market sits at $27 $200,000 is very much in the cards for this bull market and frankly I could see it happening but 150 is looking even more likely in the same vein of diminishing returns let's go ahead and talk about how the returns have been after the recent elections [404.36s] after the 2020 election Bitcoin rallied from the election to the all-time high roughly 400% again we've got to assume diminishing returns because the market is so much larger now than it was then so let's assume we have a 50% scale factor let's assume a 200% rally from the election would be reasonable considering that's what we've seen happen before if Bitcoin were to go through a 200% Rally from the United States presidential election that would also put Bitcoin at $200,000 per coin this cycle but je how's Bitcoin going to go there so fast [435.32s] isn't the cycle almost over well no remember how we saw a bull market last about 400 Days post election well the election only happened about a month ago the all-time high would be expected based on that election data to be happening in December of 2025 and if the all-time high could be as high as $200,000 then that would give us a line that looks something like this or like this or like this or some variation of the kind a rally that started like this and ended like this makes a lot of sense this is not out of the realm of possibility for Bitcoin and it would totally fit within a logical sound [467.56s] framework for where Bitcoin could go on the logarithmic chart if you draw a line of best fit straight through the bull market thus far it points right at $200,000 by December 1st of next year so from the technical standpoint it makes a lot of sense that Bitcoin could very easily rally all the way up to 200k",

through the bull market thus far it points right at $200,000 by December 1st of next year so from the technical standpoint it makes a lot of sense that Bitcoin could very easily rally all the way up to 200k but let's talk about some of the other fundamental reasons why that's probably going to happen also first and foremost Trump has nominated cryptocurrency Advocate Paul Atkins as the new SEC chair this is a welcome addition to the administration because Paul Atkins has been seen as very Pro cryptocurrency and [499.16s] it makes sense that Trump would appoint someone who's Pro cryptocurrency because he's got a lot of campaign promises around cryptocurrency under Paul Atkins leadership and the new sec I would not be at all surprised to see multiple ETFs coming for other cryptocurrencies which further validate Bitcoin and would help Bitcoin to continue in a bull market because fresh Capital would be coming into the entire Market not just a Bitcoin which will hopefully help us smooth out this cycle that we've seen for so long of Bitcoin rallying and dropping 85% rallying and dropping 85% if we see more ETFs coming in if we see more regulatory Clarity we should be [530.24s] able to see a more gradual uptrend where we have the same kind of gains but without quite as much crazy volatility this would attract ever more investors into the cryptocurrency space and help Bitcoin to be become the kind of thing that people invest in for retirement which as we know is a multi- TENS of trillions of dollar market which leads us to my next Point Bitcoin is now well on its way to flipping the value of gold at current the estimated market capitalization of gold stands at roughly $18 trillion at current the market capitalization of Bitcoin stands at roughly $2 trillion riddle me this why [560.68s] would Bitcoin doing what gold does but better having teleportation properties where you can send it anywhere in the world without having to send 50,000 mercenaries to protect the gold transport not overtake the market capitalization of gold why would it not do that why not by the way the total gold Supply increases by about 3% year-over-year as more mining occurs and when you incorporate full gear recycled gold Supply it Rose by 9% so let's give this trade Bitcoin does gold better than gold why again do you think bitcoin's not going to flip in Gold when Bitcoin does gold better than gold I don't know [592.48s] you answer me that that's your problem here's the bottom line people believe in Bitcoin because For the First Time in human history they have the opportunity to Achieve Financial sovereignty in a way that does not involve excess government intervention our taxes of unfortunate and necessary fact of life yes do they need to be as high as they are nowhere near there's so much government waste but are they going anywhere probably not does regulation need to exist yes does it need to be as enormous as it is no and it 90% of the regulations on the books and 90% of the tax code needs to be completely eradicated in the next four years [623.16s] hopefully a lot of that will happen but the bottom line is this people know that government has a tendency to grow people know the government because that is the ultimate authority of the land has the propensity to get bigger and people don't like that because entities that get bigger without checks on them end up becoming totalitarian eventually and that's where we've seen continued government overreach over the years and decades that we've been watching that happen the only way to keep accountability for an organization that cannot be kept accountable is to have a secondary method of achieving exactly [654.88s] what it is that you need to achieve instead of having everything in the dollar and being slaves to the United States government and having your money vanish before your eyes because of the amount of government spending and money printing going on you have the ability to hold Bitcoin where it does not lose its value over time because of inflation and people around the world to the tunes of hundreds of millions of them are waking up to the importance of that Bitcoin has become a top 10 asset the world over it's pass silver and it's going to pass gold eventually and if you watch this video and listen to what we have to say then you can be a part of that so what should you do here what's [685.32s] the application the most important thing that you can do right now is to build a habit of acquiring Bitcoin if that is what aligns with your beliefs don't do it just cuz I said so do the research figure out whether you think it's going to appreciate in value try and figure out whether you have faith in the project and if you do it's very important that you put some kind of system in place to actually accumulate Bitcoin for us we buy Bitcoin every single day we have a recurring Buy on we buy Bitcoin every day doesn't matter the price I don't care we buy Bitcoin every day because one day it's going to be massively higher than it is right now [715.44s] brass tax is this guys I don't want you to get left behind I got into Bitcoin when it was $22,900 now it's at 100K I wish that I had put more money into Bitcoin over the last s years and by the way I put a lot of money into Bitcoin over the last 7 years so don't walk through your life with the kind of regret that has paved the way to where Bitcoin is right now so many people have so much regret because they didn't buy more and I don't want that to be you so make sure if you truly believe in Bitcoin to do something about it so that your future self will than your current self go on an exchange consider setting up a recurring purchase if that's what [746.88s] you choose to do I'm not trying to be your registered investment advisor but I do want to encourage you if you believe that Bitcoin is the future do something about it if you enjoyed today's video

                  "content": "so I think it starts with bit Bitcoin solving the thing that I brought up earlier about the mismatch between transactions and settlement speeds um so from literally the invention of the telegraph uh until just before the invention of Bitcoin we didn't have fast settlements we had fast transactions but we didn't have fast settlements so we had an inherent really big mismatch and what Bitcoin kind of is is the invention of fast settlement fast digital settlement it's a way to send value to someone that is that is permanent final [31.04s] settled value unless of course majority of the network of many different entities decides to reverse it which is not not not really thing that happened bitcoin's journey toward a potential $120,000 price point is more than just Market speculation it's a reflection of its growing role as a transformative financial asset since its Creation in 2008 Bitcoin has revolutionized Financial systems solving inefficiencies like settlement delays reversals and Central ized control by leveraging its [62.28s] decentralized blockchain Bitcoin enables fast secure and final transactions making it a Cornerstone of modern Finance ly Alden emphasizes that bitcoin's ongoing Bull Run showcases its unique ability to bridge the gap between transaction speed and settlement certainty creating a seamless Global value transfer system the surge in institutional adoption and the rise of decentralized Finance defi highlight bitcoin's expanding influence as a hedge against inflation and a store of value [95.16s] as bitcoin's price trends upward its resilience through Market Corrections signals a broader Financial Revolution alden's analysis underscores that this rally isn't just about short-term growth it's a validation of bitcoin's profound and lasting impact on the global economy watch clips from Lyn alden's interview to gain more insight don't forget to like subscribe and enable notific for additional in-depth content thanks for joining us again enjoy the video I [126.08s] think that um it's cool that that option exists for people that want it to I just I don't really see it taking off um and I've I've touched on that that you know kind of system before one is that it's it's involved in a chain of credit um and credit isn't necessarily always a bad thing sometimes sometimes credit gives you efficiency um but the problem with that system is you have to rely on credit so with Bitcoin you have the option you could you could use it non-custodial um you could use it custodi um depending on on what your what your preference is for efficiency [156.88s] you know maybe for maybe for working capital I don't mind having a little bit at custodial whereas like for savings I want it non-custodial people can you know pick whatever they want where at Gold there's no choice you have to go through this like layered chain of custody with that whole process um secondarily gold uh the supply inflates by about 1.5% per year on average due to new mining um so you're you're you're choosing to hold the money that has less debasement than Fiat but more debasement than Bitcoin over the long run um uh and um [190.96s] it generally kind of goes against gresham's law which is um uh people if fiat currency exists there's not a big incentive for people to say I want to hold gold and spend gold they'll say well I'll hold savings assets whether it's gold whether it's whether it's Bitcoin and I'll just spend the fat that can be someone else's problem like I'll just spend Fiat for things um and and that that circulates with higher velocity uh I I just don't think there's a lot of people for which that solution is solving a problem for them and [221.92s] instead there's just a a fairly small number of people that are more ideological about it they want to hold gold and therefore they want to be able to spend their gold which is great that that solution exists uh for for them yes and and and people often say why can't you make a gold back crypto and the answer is there there are there's there's like there's gold back stablecoin things um and there's a market for it um just not a very big one um and it's just not solving a lot of problems that people have and one of the things I like to point out again I go back and forth United States and Egypt [253.60s] you know regardless of where I am in the world there are ways to access my Bitcoin like there's uh you know you can you can have all sorts of multisig uh collaborative custody globally disperse keys and things like that um and so and you with gold you know when I'm in Egypt I can't access any gold I might have in the US when I'm in the US I can't access any gold I might have in Egypt other than through trusted third parties you know if I hold my gold in a vault in Singapore and uh you know that's great but it it's it's this chain of custody [286.04s] um and so it's not that it's not a solution it's just that it's it's clearly a limited solution it doesn't kind of fundamentally solve the problem it it just kind of um Band-Aids the problem to be clear I mean I I i' like gold I've I've you know I've I've owned gold for quite a long time um I certainly preferred over government bonds uh between the two so I I don't consider myself an antagonist for gold bugs um it's just that I I I view Bitcoin as doing a lot of things that gold proponents wished that gold could [316.88s] do Lyn Alden underscores bitcoin's transformative role in addressing the limitations of traditional Financial systems particularly gold-backed currencies and credit-based systems gold historically a relable store of value suffers from annual Supply inflation of around 1.5% due to mining which erodes its value over time Bitcoin with its fixed Supply stands as a more inflation resistant alternative while gold-backed cryptocurrencies exist Alden points out [347.64s] their limited appeal and inability to address core issues like accessibility making Bitcoins decentralized and globally accessible nature a Superior Solution Alden also envisions Bitcoin evolving into a dominant Global asset potentially rivaling Gold's 20 trillion Market she highlights bitcoin's growing adoption and Universal accessibility contrasting its appeal with the constrained utility of Fiat currencies like the Egyptian pound drawing parallels to the internet's disruptive Evolution she predicts Bitcoin will [379.20s] significantly reshape the Global Financial system pressuring traditional currencies despite potential challenges such as Quantum Computing Alden asserts that Bitcoin stru Cal Innovations ensure its long-term viability and its position as a scalable reliable asset for Financial Security let's get back to the video and watch more clips from the interview so I think uh 10 20 years I think it increasingly becomes Global Capital um I think that right you know right now the network size is like under [410.16s] $2 trillion doll you know I think that first we got to first we got to get as big as gold which now with the price increase is is estimated to be something like 20 trillion or you know um 15 trillion some something in that ballpark um so I would say first we have to add another zero to to Market size um because one of the ways I describe it is that Bitcoin is money but it doesn't it's not a super densely salable money in any one area so if I take the dollar [440.40s] let actually take a simple example if I take the Egyptian pound it is very salable in Egypt with Egyptian pounds I can buy almost anything from any Merchant as soon as I go outside of Egypt that is terrible money and it's because it's got this Monopoly in Egypt and this cultural acceptance of it but then it's almost useless anywhere else um and most most currencies are like that a couple top currencies like the dollar and the Euro they are very salable in their own jurisdiction and then there's still a number of ways to transfer exchange it outside of the [471.84s] jurisdiction but it it there's more friction there um Bitcoin is interesting because in in most Urban centers in the world you can find some people that would accept Bitcoin or at the very least if you have Bitcoin with you you can find someone to transfer it for the local currency and then spend it fairly easily certainly easier than I could I could get Egyptian pounds off my hands here in the United States and quickly just go buy something with dollars um and so it it is gradually monetizing but doesn't have a very dense base um but I think that over time as it gets larger and [503.80s] larger and larger um that starts to become more relevant um the other big thing is that governments try to hold it back with capital gains taxes so that every single every single transaction you do is you have to record it and pay taxes on it um and there's some you know El Salvador has eliminated that um over time you could see more countries start to get pressured to by their people to to eliminate that and elect politicians that that eliminate that and just make it a money so I think when we're talking 10 20 years I think we're talking more [534.96s] like becoming a really big Global asset with some monetary characteristics uh but then eventually in the longer Arc of time uh it has good attributes for money in my opinion and will it will increasingly pressure um via currencies I think digital money with zero debasement is a pretty powerful long-term concept um and Bitcoin does gradually update over time so you know the ethernet that we use now is not the ethernet that was invented 50 years ago [565.12s] uh but it updates in these Backward Compatible ways um and so I I think that you know it'll it'll it'll update over time you know maybe no line of code Bitcoin 100 years from now is the same uh line of code that it is now but I think the concept and the the the chain of continuity of",

                  "content": "the king of Bitcoin to be a part of it with me and uh and so that's how we put it together but I just want you to think about what I'm saying if I'm right this is going to be worth 10x where it is today and that would make it the size of gold and gold Julia in terms of the overall capitalization of liquid assets around the world at1 trillion it's still quite small it's still quite insignificant so Bitcoin can get to that [30.16s] number frankly without surprising anybody without having to be a Monumental move or Monumental monetary crisis anywhere in our society I said at the beginning of this year having Cycles coming in April wherever this thing is in April it'll be 4X that by the end of the cycle Bitcoin has been gaining significant Traction in recent years transforming from a niche digital asset to a mainstream Financial instrument at the beginning of 2024 the cryptocurrency 's value was poised for another surge [62.40s] with experts predicting substantial gains one prominent Market analyst Anthony scari forecasted in April when Bitcoin was around $60,000 that it could reach $170,000 by the end of the cycle this bullish Outlook is driven by a combination of factors including increased institutional adoption improved Market infrastructure and the growing possibility of positive regulatory developments that could further fuel invest confidence the increasing institutional interest in [93.32s] Bitcoin coupled with its growing acceptance as a store of value has positioned it as a potential hedge against inflation and financial instability additionally bitcoin's having events which reduce the rate of new coin issuance have historically contributed to Upward price momentum with the latest having in April 2024 many analysts including Anthony scaramucci are anticipating that bitcoin's price will continue its up trajectory possibly reaching new all-time highs watch clips from Anthony [125.08s] scaramucci's interview to gain more insight don't forget to like subscribe and enable notifications for additional in-depth content thanks for joining us again enjoy the video so I have Buffett's view of the market longterm you know I understand that Mr Buffett is selling stocks now he's built a a cash cash War chest of $350 billion if we have a 20 or 30% correction in the market people look back at that say okay well Buffett saw something he didn't [155.20s] like where asset prices were he didn't like where the market was priced relative to GDP relative to forward earnings relative to book and so he started shedding some of his assets he's 93 or 94 he's a very very smart brilliant investor I do like to follow him so there could be some air pockets ahead for the market I'm not saying that there isn't but I have his longer term view of the market meaning I look at the market right now and it could be expensive on all those metrics but there's something happening that is [187.12s] transformed it's very very different from the revolution uh and so when I was in my mid-30s like you are today uh we had a doom Revolution and in 1999 we were told that eyeballs mattered and companies like Yahoo the RO company were doing very very well and they had very hard to justify valuations uh and then the market imploded those stocks went down 40 50 60 80% some of those companies went out of business but [218.16s] the great companies like an Amazon may have gone down 80 or 90% but look at where it is today if you had the foresight that just hold on to these positions or to build a position and so I can't pick the day where the Market's going to correct but it's not a matter of if the market will correct it's when the market will because this is the nature of stock market is the nature of cycle so when I look at AI is there an AI bubble perhaps there is uh is there a bubble in the mag 7 you know those seven [249.92s] Great stocks that are all worth a trillion plus dollars and they are heavily if you cap adust the S&P 500 they're have I know 25 30% of the overall 500 and so would you be concerned about that I would but then I look at the Monumental amounts of growth the productivity gains the age of Robotics the age of therapy you know talking about biotechnology we're we're moving from chemotherapy to [280.00s] immunotherapy we're moving from they're going to take cells out of your body and they're going to make a tumor and then they're going to put it into an AI chamber and they're going to develop compounds yeah to hit the cells with and then the the computer is going to say you know this person's DNA is sequenced this way and these drug compounds will eliminate that tumor without causing any negative overall negative impacts on the patients's body right so we're moving from chemotherapy to advances and [311.40s] immunotherapy it's going to drop the percentage of Health Care that we the GDP percentage that we spend on Health Care the Robotics are going to improve the way we're delivering goods and service going to lower cost it's a disinflationary thing uh AI is going to in some ways hurt certain industries and hurt certain jobs but every time that that's happened better jobs have come out of it what happened is because of the proactive suppression of the digital economy [342.44s] digital Assets in the United States by Elizabeth Warren and Gary Gensler the prices that you're seeing today in my mind people oh wow Bitcoin zoomed up no Bitcoin was artificially suppressed by poor Regulators capricious arbitrary zaris like Regulators that have now been removed from the system due to the fairness of a democracy and they're gone and so now the price is back to where it should have been and could have been in January of [374.52s] 2022 and so I think these prices are actually low I think these prices are going a lot higher once we get bipartisan Clarity on what a security is versus a token what a what's the clarity on stable coin regulation what are the rules okay will the F will the SEC resend its lawsuit against coinbase and Kraken and then provide rules now all the SEC has done is they're trying to regulate by enforcement and they're forcing people [405.16s] to spend millions of dollars on legal fees and shoot in the dark trying to get something right Anthony scaramucci envisions a transformative financial future blending Warren Buffett's long-term stock market philosophy with a bold Embrace of innovation he predicts AI biotech and Bitcoin will shape Global economies paralleling the dot Resurgence where giants like Amazon emerged from ashes scaramucci critiques us regulatory suppression of digital assets championing Bitcoin as a strategic [435.96s] Powerhouse akin to new oil with institutional adoption surging forecasting a $ 150,000 to $300,000 valuation within 5 years he argues Bitcoin could rival Gold's market cap his message Embrace volatility think long-term and harness the power of innovation for unparalleled growth the future belongs to resilient Visionaries let's watch more clips from the interview I'm still close to a lot of people that talk to president Trump fairly regularly he tells people that [466.92s] Bitcoin is the new oil he sees it as a potential strategic Reserve issue for the United States he sees it as something that the United States needs to be a big part of and so I applaud him for I like calling balls and Strikes on people and I think they've done a they've done a good job so far of laying out a framework uh and the last thing which I think is also very important is there are Senators like jell bran our Senator here and Senators like Schumer senior senator from New York that have told [499.32s] people privately myself included that they want cryptocurrency stable coin Clarity in terms of what the legis is going to look like and they're hoping to do that in the first year of the next Congressional term so for all those Reasons from a regulatory point of view and from a demand point of view you'd have to be bullish on this asset class I'm going to own some Bitcoin the state of Wisconsin the pension fund said we're going to own it they announced $150 million purchase um I didn't speak to [532.20s] anybody there but I I know how pension fund managers think if you're not long Bitcoin your short Bitcoin and let me explain why because it will eventually be in the pie chart of global tactical asset allocation so every big pension fund has some gold every big pension fund has real estate they have private Equity they have stocks and bonds they have other assets uh and Bitcoin is going to work its way into that asset [562.76s] mix and again maybe it'll only be Julia one or 2% but then you'll need to own it right because going to be compared when the Consultants come in to speak to you or your board comes in to speak to you they're going to compare your performance to the overall pie chart of tactical asset allocation and Bitcoin is going to be part of that and so you got to get along it because if you're not long it you're going to be short it just want you to think about what I'm saying if I'm right this is going to be worth 10x where it is today and that would [594.00s] make it the size of gold and gold Julia in terms of the over capitalization of liquid assets around the world at $18 trillion it's still quite small it's still quite insignificant so Bitcoin can get to that number frankly without surprising anybody without having to be a Monumental move or Monumental monetary crisis anywhere in our society I bought it at 17 it went to 69 and it went back [624.96s] to 15 but thank God okay I had had at least at this point in my career the patience the",

                  "content": "I have bet pretty much everything on the altcoin season I'm talking about my entire family's safety everything my entire career has been placed on this one bet which is monetizing the altcoin season and right now today marks the moment where I believe I officially found the data I've been looking for that confirms the altcoin cycle has started I have been patient for a long time I've been putting in the work and [31.16s] this happens every four years a one in foure chance to break generational poverty and to make a whole bunch of money on small cryptocurrencies that could potentially do 100x returns and don't forget that last cycle and a cycle before that on average the top 10 coins by market cap size increased by 9 4,000% this is a one in a-lifetime opportunity that just got confirmed Bitcoin just [63.64s] broke 100K right before our eyes as you can see right there Bitcoin is above 100K and it's been like three separate times it is definitely fighting right now as we speak and it's probably because Amazon shareholders are proposing a 5% Bitcoin treasury as you can see at the bottom resolved shareholders request that the board conduct an assessment to determine if adding Bitcoin to the company treasury [93.84s] is in the best interest of long-term interest of shareholders we also have microor presenting to Microsoft The Firm could add almost five trillion to its market cap if they were to go all in on bitcoin Microsoft will vote on whether to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet on December 10th we have the world's biggest tech companies all potential adding Bitcoin to their treasury this is a major warning for anyone that is not [126.24s] involved with crypto if you are not involved you need to pay attention to what's going on in the world Bitcoin being above 100K as you can see right there and kind of staying above it fighting above 100K is not even the best thing that I just found about altcoin season because these percentages on altcoin season are going to be absurd maybe Bitcoin goes to 150k maybe 200k that's a 50 to 100% increase in this video I'm going to show you data that confirms the altcoin season and these coins will go up 10,000 20,000% like [158.96s] they always do every single cycle consistently the money-making opportunity is happening right before your eyes and I know it's easy to think about the short term and get caught up in the short-term noise like the 24hour percentages on altcoins I know they've been bleeding but I'm telling you right now if you stay resilient if you stay locked in and if you invest for longer periods of time long term think about the long term be grateful for what you have this is where the money is made pay attention this is shortterm noise you [191.56s] have to remember that this is what you signed up for if you wanted something safe you could have bought gold or oil or houses or something like that we are in crypto it's an asymmetrical opportunity meaning High rewards but it's going to have high risk and although it says low risk here the reason why I say it's low is because you could only lose your initial investment meaning if you invest $1,000 you could only lose that ,000 but High returns in [222.76s] crypto there's a potential for $10,000 20,000 you know 30,000 per increase so in general the market says high risk High reward yes it's high risk but just remember if you allocate your money properly AKA risk risk management it's technically low risk in my opinion because we have an upside potential of 30,000 but we have a lowside potential of only 100% which is your initial investment so if you feel emotional [253.56s] right now because of this small dip in altcoins you have to assess if you are investing off of emotion and completely remove all of the emotion out of your Investments please if you're watching this video you know I've been talking about this for a while because it will ruin you during the altcoin cycle which just started at the peak people are going to be emotional and my goal is to stay away from that I would not touch [283.76s] emotional trading with a 10-ft poll pay attention to what I'm saying this could set you up for success in the future and make you a lot of money when it comes to crypto investing and if you want to learn how I manage my risk when I buy altcoins so that I can mitigate all of these crazy losses and not get emotional with investing I'm going to be releasing an email that will talk about this software so you can get it for free it's coin.io you can always use it whenever you want to buy into cryptocurrencies the right way but if you want a tutorial [316.64s] on how to use this software I'm going to be releasing an email the link will be in the pinned comment below and in that email I will break down step by step exactly how to use the Martingale strategy in combination with this specific software and again it's 100% free the goal of the email newsletter is to Simply give you information that I can't give you on YouTube because social media is different than training so go to the link in the pin comment below [347.52s] click that link sign up for the newsletter and I'm going to be sending you an email that breaks down exactly how to use this risk management calculator for free let's keep our eyes on the prize crypto is upgrading the traditional Financial system with better technology regardless of where these assets go it's better it's as simple as that this is a recent tweet from Elon Musk talking about in June of 2019 the GAO identified 10 critical Federal it [378.88s] Legacy systems that were obsolete so this is the federal system that's obsolete the current banking system is even worse it's way worse you could send $5 billion right now from one side of the Earth to the other side of the Earth for like a $5 transaction fee and a billion dollar transaction has happened before in the past for like five bucks with Bitcoin and crypto cryptocurrency is simply better the technology is [411.00s] upgrading not only the banking system but also the internet as a whole listen to what I'm saying keep your eyes on the prize and think longer term and you will not have a problem let's jump into the data on the altcoin season so we can see exactly what's going on with these coins let's first take a look at the altcoin season index and basically how this works is if the 75% of the top 50 coins perform better than Bitcoin over the last season 90 days it is officially an [441.92s] altcoin season and they excluded stable coins so if we scroll down here the beauty about this is it shows in comparison to percentages so it's it's showing percentages let me say it again percentages so this is really something that I look at when it comes to making money why because when people look at pure price price doesn't really work when it comes to making money because if you buy a coin at $110,000 and it goes to 20,000 that's 100% increase you officially doubled [473.04s] your money but if you buy something that's worth a penny and it goes to two pennies that's the same exact percentage increase right so percentage increase is the thing you want to look for not price a lot of people look at Price you do not want to look at it in that perspective so in this case they're doing it the right way in my personal opinion they're actually taking in consideration the thing that matters which is percentage increase now as you can see right here above this line is you know altcoin Season below this line is Bitcoin season [503.84s] so what I did is I compared this to the Bitcoin dominance chart specifically to see if it lines up so our period right here we're in December of 2024 if we come over here to the Bitcoin dominance chart as you can see it looks like we're in allcoin season you can see the market or at least Bitcoin dominance not the market the Bitcoin dominance chart is dropping look it's dropping so this really really looks like we're starting an altcoin season and the Bitcoin dominance chart is very simple to understand basically it's bitcoin's dominance over the market so when Bitcoin loses dominance altcoins are [535.32s] usually gaining dominance meaning altcoin season right it's a season where altcoin coins out compete everything else so as you can see right here Bitcoin has been losing dominance so for this indicator It lines up pretty nice now if we go to the second part right here where we kind of moved above it this is January of 2024 we go back to the Bitcoin dominance chart I actually marked it off to make it easy this is this green line right here now when it comes to January 2024 right we did see [565.40s] the Bitcoin dominance drop but it was very short term very short term because Bitcoin dominance in general was increasing look at this trend but for a short period of time Bitcoin dominance dropped as you can see right there now if we look at the next one it was very similar as you can see short period of time right so from my kind of analysis and you know kind of everything combined from what I've recently talked about you guys could reference my other videos and things of that nature let me look at [596.64s] this one really quick but I want to give you my conclusion um this is is August of 2022 so if we bring it up again that's right here so this indicator is not perfect but it gives us a gauge it's like something where you know if you see it signaling",

but it gives us a gauge it's like something where you know if you see it signaling all coin season you want to pay attention you want to open your eyes and start doing more research in other ways that will make you um you know invest or not invest or whatever the case is that will give you a conclusion right you that's the point of research guys please when it comes to investing [626.88s] in a market or you know doing research or talking talking about an indicator it's all research based you never want to you know conclude decisions based off of one specific indicator let's look at right here August September 2022 you can see it was very quick now this one right here was big this was May this one called the altcoin season this one right here called the allcoin season because you can see right here specifically we have this massive fall look at the period of time this was right here this is also considered the power cycle too which is like the [657.08s] exaggerated version of the allcoin season it's like this is the whole allcoin season this is the power cycle and we're going to have more videos on this uh there's a new research method that I'm developing but basically this is considered the altcoin season and so that indicator did call it so it was accurate one time confirmed this time it was it was technically accurate by its own math but it didn't really predict a season it predict a shortterm trend this was a [687.32s] short-term Trend this could could be it's not really confirmed but this could be an altcoin season I'm willing to lean on the fact that it is an allcoin season not because of this indicator because of other things that we're going to be talking about in this video so in general it's a good determining Factor now one thing to take in consideration I think when it comes to altcoin Seasons timing is everything so according to the Bitcoin having cycle usually the altcoin seasons happen after the Bitcoin having cycle so in this case and this case this was before the Bitcoin having cycle so [718.64s] if I had like a checklist what I would say is we have to be after the Bitcoin having and then if it flashes right the altcoin season index FL flashes then this is a good indicator to understand if we are in an altcoin season truly or not so the altcoin season index is not a perfect indicator sometimes it predicts like shortterm noise when it comes to the actual altcoin season sometimes it actually predicts the full-blown altcoin season we have to combine that with other metrics like for example the allcoin season probably is going to [749.28s] happen after the Bitcoin having right that's one piece of data that's crucial it has to happen after the Bitcoin having maybe in the future this changes but like at least right now that's been the case 100% of the time we have the Bitcoin having Bitcoin goes up in value and then after the Bitcoin having we usually have an altcoin season that's something to write down and take notes please take notes let's move on to some other indicators if we combine them it kind of paints a nice story now let's look at this chart from another perspective Ive at the top here is the [780.80s] Bitcoin dominance we talked about that and at the bottom here we have specifically bitcoin's price so if we look at the point and start of the allcoin Season which is right here and we just take simply this date length right here from the start of the altcoin season this is altcoin season from right here to the top of Bitcoin that's about 290 days now if we do that again the second altcoin cycle we have 308 days from from the start of the altcoin cycle [812.28s] to the top of Bitcoin now I've talked about it in other video specifically when it comes to overe excitement this usually ends all bubble type markets especially new emerging asset classes when people get overly excited meaning people are just buying altcoins like crazy I believe usually the altcoin cycle itself the ecosystem all of the altcoins are the reason why cryptocurrency ends I believe the start of cryptocurrency is because of the Bitcoin having cycle Bitcoin only has 21 [843.40s] million Bitcoin in existence this is a scarcity element that you don't find anywhere else in human in the world you don't find it anywhere else right so when they decrease the issuance which is they cut the amount of Bitcoin that come out every 15 minutes in half there's a scarcity element to that and this is what starts these great Bitcoin having cycles that we always see and hopefully you understand this if you don't understand this you know refer to my previous videos I talk about the Bitcoin having but that starts the market what [874.68s] ends the market is usually the OV excitement in altcoins it's like this massive exit where altcoins just do absurd numbers it's over everyone's going crazy and the bubble Pops that usually sends us into a bare market now the reason I'm saying that is because we see that in the charts we see it specifically so if I believe for example that Bitcoin was topping out for whatever reason if I thought that Bitcoin was going to top out I would be like hey maybe allcoin season's over I don't believe Bitcoin is going to top [905.08s] out I believe that from the start of the altcoin season and this is going against what I previously said this is why you guys should stay up to date with my videos what I'm doing is I'm consistently right updating you on my thought process is like a journal for me so you know my thoughts in real time right it's going to always change if it didn't change I wouldn't be doing research this is important to understand is don't ever take information on the internet as conclusive decision making data you should always be updating your thesis on a consistent basis and as you can see right here from [936.16s] the official start if say hypothetically this was the official start let's say this is the official start of the allcoin season right that means that according to history it's going to take approximately 300 days for Bitcoin to top out and for altcoins to stop pumping so this altcoin season could potentially last 300 days from this point which will take us out to September of 20 September October November I should really say that you guys should think about selling in July August July August are thinking [967.40s] about like taking money off the table for sure if you guys want to get out of the market so that's important to understand now another prediction I did which would help you know confirm this current altcoin season is looking at the Bitcoin having to when we actually started the altcoin season so if we look at the Bitcoin having and we look at the period where we actually started allcoin season that's 264 days right we have 237 on the second cycle so everything looks pretty consistent and right now we're looking at approximately 220 so again [999.36s] consistency this to me confirms a lot of things is it perfect no but it's consistent and that's what I always look for in data something that's consistent so again I'm leaning towards the fact that allcoin season already started that's what I'm leaning towards and there's more data that would actually confirm this as well now before getting into the next part it kind requires an understanding of liquidity now this is going to be a deep training take notes do what you have to do because I'm really going to explain it I want as many people to know this as possible [1029.80s] market cap is not a good indicator to understand if a coin is small or big what a lot of people say is they say micro cap right they're like oh it's micro it's small this does not mean the Project's small and I know this goes against pretty much like 90% of the influencers and I used to be there this is where experience comes into play I've been doing this for eight years guys what if I told you that I do not look at market cap literally at all ever again it is such a misleading indicator and [1061.76s] I'm going to explain it right now why you should never ever ever take in consideration market cap as your kind of like Risk verifier because what people say is they say the market cap is Big so if the market cap is Big that means it's safe if the market cap is small that means it's high risk",

that means it's high risk this is not the way you should assess risk you should be assessing risk based off of liquidity let me explain why so as you can see here from the simple formula of market [1092.00s] cap in crypto it's the current market price times the circulating Supply this is how they get market cap but see the problem with that is that people fake the circulating Supply in crypto all the time they make up whatever Max Supply they make up the tokenomics they essentially make up the circulating Supply when they initially launched the coin and people in the past have manipulated the entire Market by creating a false Supply they've done [1125.16s] this they do it all the time they do it in today's day and age because people still don't understand market cap all the time and let me show you what I mean by that sheu is the perfect example of manipulation when it comes to market cap they did it last cycle and they did it success as you can see here Shea enu went up 152,000 in comparison to bitcoin going up 66% and this is like turning like this this is like crazy by the way like 152,000 per is like turning ,000 into 1.5 million and 335 days I got into [1157.16s] Shibu pretty early to be honest with you um I got in right here I sold a little bit early I should have held I would have made way more money but this was the perfect example of manipulation they made an artificial Supply a fake Supply on purpose just to Simply come up higher on the market cap websites all they wanted to do is come up higher in the market cap websites so that more people would buy the coin and they would like manipulate and finesse everybody into thinking the coins cheap because if I show you it's like less than a penny or [1187.72s] something like that so they made the price purposely extremely cheap and they made the market cap purposely extremely big so they finessed everybody that thought that cheap price means cheap coin it doesn't that does not mean cheap coin cheap price does not mean cheap coin it doesn't because if you buy into Bitcoin for example it's worth 100 Grand right Bitcoin is worth 100 Grand if it goes to 150 Grand you have made 50% on your money if you buy a coin at $10 and it goes to $15 you have made 50% of your [1219.12s] money so in one case you made $50,000 in the other case you made $5 but it's both the same percentage increase because if you bought a fraction of a Bitcoin and it went up 50% % and you bought a fraction of whatever other coin and it went up 50% you make the same amount of money so price doesn't mean cheap price doesn't mean cheap and market cap doesn't mean safe both of those thoughts are pure manipulation on the market let me show you Sheba enu Supply look at the market cap of Sheba enu it's 17.6 [1250.32s] billion guys that's billion would it be look at the price it's less than a penny and look at how much Supply they have they have five 89 trillion she coins why do they have so many coins Bitcoin only has 21 million in existence why do they have so many coins so as you can see from the tokenomics they printed one quadrillion coins and then put 50% of the total Supply inside of the decentralized exchange Unis swap to provide liquidity right so the keys to [1282.88s] this liquidity pool were destroyed to ensure the tokens remain there permanently so they basically took half of the supply put it in Unis Swap and locked it up so to me that's not really circulating is it that's not circulating within the community how could that be circulating Supply it's not it's a finesse so that they can have a bigger supply they can qualify as a circulating Supply on the website so they can come up higher on coin market cap and get a whole bunch more exposure because the coins that go [1314.68s] to the top of coinmarketcap.com which is the most viewed website in all of cryptocurrency they go to the top based off of market cap so it gives it exposure they basically made the coin to finesse the coin website so they can get free exposure and they made it really really small in price so that people can think it's cheap I mean we can go down the line I don't know like what else you need like they basically manufactured this coin to go viral and this is why price and market cap are not good [1344.76s] metrics they get finessed all the time so again circulating Supply is literally manufactured to whatever the coin founder wants in their tokenomics right manufactured this gives whatever price it is a higher multiple a huge multile right this will increase the multile of any price by a lot because this is a multiplication equation right and so this makes artificial market caps and pretty much gets a lot more exposure but let me show you something that can't be [1375.20s] finessed if you're looking for the same metric the same type of understanding of an asset right you want to understand is something truly cheap like and the purpose of understanding if something's truly cheap the purpose of that is to buy cheap stuff so that goes up in value you want a coin that goes up in value basically that's why people look at price and market cap because they want something that they they can afford that will go up in value right liquidity is your answer liquidity gives you the accurate measurement of something that is high risk or low risk [1405.32s] let me show you so look at this right here look at the plus two liquidity depth the liquidity depth is a more accurate measure this is the capital required to increase the price of an asset by 2% and then the minus two is the exact opposite Capital required to reduce the price by 2% so as you can see right here on binance if somebody put $1.4 million into Sheba enu they would increase the price of shibba enu on binance only on binance by 2% so to get [1435.68s] the liquidity from centralized exchanges because that's what we're looking at you could basically add all these up and you know average it out or whatever the case is but this changes too frequently for that but that's the point is that the liquidity is the answer if you're looking for price increase or decrease right it's liquidity so if this number was a thousand then it would be very easy to pump the price of the coin up and to dump the price of the coin down right that's what it means when it comes to cheapness and expensiveness right this is expensive Sheba enu is so [1466.04s] expensive the price will not move it's not going to move in comparison to some of the old coins we always talk about let me show you an altcoin I've been talking about for a long time look at the price of Myra Myra is literally more expensive than shivba enu but look at the plus two liquidity depth it only takes $113,000 $223,000 to pump the price of this coin by 2% that's it this is cheaper but it's also higher risk so when it comes to gauging risk you should be looking at [1497.64s] liquidity if there a project that has a lot of liquidity then this is considered safer if a project has a whole bunch of liquidity this is this is what safeness look like right if a project doesn't have that much liquidity that means it moves really fast that's high volatility AKA risk this is what you should be looking at now the reason why I'm talking about this is because when we look at the altcoin season we're making the same mistake pretty much everyone now there's no indicator we're going to probably make it I have to make it G try [1529.00s] to figure out how to make it but the point is you know when it comes to looking at this this is market cap dominance we're looking at the market cap of Bitcoin it's the same thing it's the same exact thing and when people look at this uh this other thing which is others the total cryptocurrency market cap excluding top 10 so like people also",

why I'm talking about this is because when we look at the altcoin season we're making the same mistake pretty much everyone now there's no indicator we're going to probably make it I have to make it G try [1529.00s] to figure out how to make it but the point is you know when it comes to looking at this this is market cap dominance we're looking at the market cap of Bitcoin it's the same thing it's the same exact thing and when people look at this uh this other thing which is others the total cryptocurrency market cap excluding top 10 so like people also use this as a indicator to understand all coin season it's the same thing you're not taking into consideration the thing that matters the most which is the liquidity you're only [1559.16s] looking at the market cap and see the thing is around the bull market and all these you know crazy coins start being minted out of thin air people make coins for no reason bro they just make as many coins as they want so these supplies are just ruining pretty much the Integrity of most of these charts now they're okay they give us a range and they're pretty accurate but I believe if we look at liquidity this is what gave me my confirmation this is like okay well okay altcoin season started so I want to show what I mean by that all right let's look [1589.64s] at how cryptocurrencies work with liquidity right so every cryptocurrency is either on a chain or it's a chain itself meaning there's actually a difference a crypto is something like ethereum and then a token is on etherium which is a smart contract platform so think about it this way so let's say hypothetically you have a computer like mac right that would be like ethereum the apps on your computer would be like the tokens like the small tokens so there's all these different operating systems like for example ethereum is one [1621.72s] salana is another and on these operating systems they have money which is tvl AKA total value locked which is the total amount of value that's locked up on the actual chain right so I used to think that this is a great indicator for picking altcoins for example if I wanted to buy an altcoin on base right so Bas is definitely one of those chains that I'm looking at right so if I bought an altcoin on base it can make me more money because they have a potential where money could flow from ethereum to [1652.84s] base right and the point is I want to be around the money right everybody should want to be around the money but okay when it comes to the understanding this you got to understand where the actual transactions happen so on every chain you have all these little altcoins let's just put these as altcoins right ethereum has a whole bunch of altcoins Base has a whole bunch of altcoins salana has a whole bunch of all coins right so there's a certain amount of tvl on the these chains and that tvl could potentially move into an altcoin right that's the point you want to [1684.40s] invest where there's a big Honeypot you want to invest where there's a massive potential liquidity does not mean price increase or decrease liquidity just simply means opportunity if there's this one area that has a lot of liquidity then the opportunity for the price to increase or decrease is a little bit higher there if there's something over there that has zero liquidity it's dry that the chance of something happening is low there's like no PO potential energy there that's liquidity liquidity is potential energy it's money it's where the action happens right so the [1715.96s] point is is that right here if we have a lot of liquidity which I think the last time I checked I forgot the exact numbers but it's like I think like 50 billion or something like that and I think like salana was like eight billion and you could look at this on uh defi llama and I think base was like three billion I don't know I don't remember I don't remember but let's just say hypothetically we had these three different opportunities right we have three different chains with three different tvls the opportunity on eth would be greater why because there's more liquidity there's more opportunity [1746.28s] for money to flow into the coin you're buying right but see the thing is if we get very detailed and specific okay there's a point from the liquidity to the actual coin that we have to take in consideration and that's the decentralized exchange so let's say hypothetically we have a chain right and then we have the coin being purchased or sold in between that is a decentralized exchange so the from the chain the money from the chain let's say there's dollars on the on this right here they have to [1776.40s] go through a DEX pool to get to the coin for the price to go crazy and for us to make a whole bunch of money right they have to go through a DEX so the potential energy the liquidity is technically on the Chain but if you want to get more specific you want to look at the liquidity on the deck on the decentralized exchange now the reason I'm saying this again I want to kind of Bring It All home people are looking at market cap when they're trying to determine specifically altcoin Seasons [1806.96s] right the altcoin season index it looks at percentages which is great but a better determining factor in my opinion is when all of the money starts flowing into altcoins we don't know what type of altcoins we don't know the percentages but basically when the liquidity of the top decentralized exchanges start going ballistic to me that's all season and we're going to be coming up with indicators I'm try to build indicators from scratch hopefully somebody doesn't take this video I mean do it whatever man I want to see it anyways but the [1837.20s] point is is that I want to know when all the liquidity started flowing into crypto but specifically on a decentralized exchange and if you know your history the biggest decentralized exchange that pretty much started all of the altcoin season last cycle was Unis Swap and we could see the data on Unis swap that's the beauty of onchain investigation in crypto let me show you so this indicator right here really showed me that altcoin season is confirmed I believe we [1867.64s] are we have already started the altcoin season and so what we're looking at here is the tvl specifically on Unis swap if you know anything about the decentralized world there was nothing that was even compared to Unis swap back in the day they were the biggest and best with the most liquidity they started the altcoin cycle I believe you know with their liquidity pools and everything like that if you do your research you could see that they have the most TVO they currently have the most TVO right now too so they have $ 4.51 billion do in their liquidity pools [1899.48s] now there's other videos where I talk about how a liquidity pool is made and works and I'm not going to go into that in this video maybe we'll do that in you know future leave a comment below if you guys want to talk about liquidity pools but the point is is that we have a lot of value and this is the point this is the point of potential energy this is where people start getting crazy now there's a better chart on defi llama specifically and it shows these just big liquidity spikes so if we look at like for example look at this crazy liquidity Spike look at April 2021 right if we [1931.28s] compare that to the Bitcoin dominance this is the power cycle I've been talking about for the past like 20 videos look March April right in the middle of everything going crazy and Ballistic you know what's crazy about that is we come over here to Sha euu right let's look look right here March April April look coin on shibba Inu started taking off when all of the liquidity started going up it's those liquidity spikes that's what we're [1963.72s] looking for those big liquidity spikes look April and if you look at the top 10 all coins by percentage increase it will show you that they're all pretty much consistent let me show you real quick so these are the best producing alt coins last cycle look January February February March April well this one was a little early April is over here but it's around the same period of time look at this right here January February March April and this is also when Bitcoin had its first top look at how crazy this is look January February [1996.08s] March April right so it's really consistent it's those liquidity spikes this one was a little early uh they actually started the altcoin cycle last cycle from what I remember when I was doing my research look this is April right here January February March April this is April this is like the determining Factor this is like",

right let's look look right here March April April look coin on shibba Inu started taking off when all of the liquidity started going up it's those liquidity spikes that's what we're [1963.72s]

those liquidity spikes this one was a little early uh they actually started the altcoin cycle last cycle from what I remember when I was doing my research look this is April right here January February March April this is April this is like the determining Factor this is like the beginning right same thing April these are the top 10 percentage coins by you know just percentage like the best thing we're looking for look this is April right so you want to get in a little bit [2027.28s] earlier right so if we come back over to the initial chart this is like when you want to get in right and so let's look at where we're at now we're about to break I think we already broke alltime high so this is right here 7.7 we're at we're about to break alltime high this to me is a confirmation once we break the all-time high of this recent local top right it's a wrap we're just going [2057.96s] to go north from here and to be real with you guys we're not even at where we were at before last cycle to me I believe the liquidity is going to double or triple where were we at last cycle I think we're going to be extremely high like way higher than we were last cycle so if there's any developers out there put together something that shows the liquidity of all of the exchanges only that's all I want I just want all of the exchanges only that's it just only the exchanges and if you do put that together please reach out to me on my [2089.12s] email or something let's have let's have a conversation but the point is I just want to see only the liquidity from the exchanges that's all I care about because this only shows un swap but if we combine it into one chart and I'm pretty sure there's charts out there I just haven't looked deep enough I'm pretty sure I'll find it for next video but the point is if we just find all of the liquidity on all the biggest decentralized exchanges in one place from salana all the layer ones all the layer twos and we look at the growth of it in comparison to last cycle this is the best determining factor for allcoin season in my opinion by far and there's [2120.52s] no second best or comparison at all so to me just looking at this data right now we're about to break previous alltime high and this will send us I mean we're already confirmed to be an allcoin season guys I believe we are in an allcoin season for a fact right now so the next thing is to start buying coins so I want to end this video with a talk about diligence in cryptocurrency what you guys have to understand is that this Market is so new that when it comes to learning it the materials to learn it are being developed in real time people [2152.88s] don't even have education for this type of stuff so understand understand diligence and take it to a level you never have before diligence basically means you look into every little detail about what you're doing right so for example if you're cooking rice you would look into every detail about it it might seem you know simple on the surface all just put in the rice maker or whatever the case is but a diligent person would study the living heck out of it they would know everything about the rice and its background they would know the top chefs that made the best rice ever they [2184.84s] would look at the top awardwinning rice and they would analyze everything about it to make the best rice it's the same thing with crypto if you're buying a coin you should not just buy the coin for Price appreciation you're going to get wrecked you have to know what platform you're buying it on you have to know how coin market cap works I study the platforms themselves so for example coin market cap I know to a high level exactly how they build it like I know to not a crazy level I'm not a developer but I know I know how that website runs [2215.96s] because I use it for a lot of my research same thing with trading view I know how to build you know charts from scratch and the more diligent you are and the tools that you're using and you understand it and just go really deep the more money you'll make and the less money you'll lose one of the biggest reasons why people think it's hard to sell crypto because like I this I get this question all the time people like hey Alex when it comes time to sell am I gonna get my money out and be able to get my money out the best answer for that is to go sell it right now why don't you go from whatever pile you have [2246.40s] you know take $10 sell it and bring it all the way to your bank account so you know the entire process you can see that it's not a Ponzi scheme and you can sell your crypto I don't know why people say that but the the point is is that the reason why these questions come up is because they're not taking their time usually what happens is if somebody talks about a altcoin on YouTube or Instagram they get super excited and their whole learning process turns into a lustful action of just simply trying to just buy the coin and ignore everything else this is why people want [2276.44s] stepbystep tutorial the reason why someone wants a step-by-step tutorial and they don't want to learn the platform is because they just want to do it and then walk away and not do anything else if you are in that mind you are not diligent this is laziness this is the definition of laziness and those people will lose their money because they're not going to know how to maneuver they're going to get hacked they're going to get scammed they're going to lose their wallet and I've seen it so many times so if there's one lesson you could take from this video is please do your diligence don't take anything at face value you if [2308.04s] somebody's telling you something and you're like in your brain like yo I like that I want to use that then you should instead of confirming that in your brain you should take a second you should go replicate what they're saying go find what they're saying replicate it like literally duplicate what they're saying and understand every variable before you take it into consideration for your research process now if you don't have a research process that's a massive red flag a huge red flag and you guys know I [2338.84s] trained people in cryptocurrency specifically we did close the doors on our product but we are opening in January so on January 1 we're opening the doors and we're going to close it again we're going to close it again and the reason why we're doing this is because we want to make sure that everybody is doing well when they come in the community we really really believe in you know an education first a results first type of approach just like school when you have like semesters we do the same thing at coin pic so in January 1st we'll be [2370.20s] reopening the doors the link will be in the pin comment below also in the pin comment below the same exact link you'll be able to sign up to our newsletter and I'm going to be releasing today at about 5:6 PM Eastern Standard Time an entire breakdown of the Martingale strategy so you don't get emotional with your Investments which will include the free software the free software that gives you access to the Martingale tool everything the entire tutorial step by step will be released in the pin comment below thank you guys for watching this [2401.08s] video please be diligent in your work take it serious treat it like a professional if there's one thing you guys could take away from my videos please in this market where it's the wow wow west of finance and everybody is buying meme coins and they're going to the Moon you know it doesn't mean that Meme coins are bad buying meme coins doesn't mean that you're not professional but you have to approach those meme coins with a very specific professional strategy that is the reason why people make money and lose money because they have systems they have [2431.40s] things that are actually consistent that they apply without any motion at all that gives them results that's what people don't have in this market and you need to have it you need to take this serious if you didn't take notes in this video take that as a sign that you are not diligent you are not diligent if you use these videos for",

This study compares the effectiveness of different rating regulatory systems. Using nine thousand two hundred and sixty-two data of Chinese corporate bonds as the research samples. Empirical analysis and robustness test reveal the following findings: (1) The issuance of the Notice has a significant positive effect on the implementation of both the dual rating system and the multiple rating system, with a greater impact on the implementation of the multiple rating system; (2) The issuance of the Notice, along with the dual rating system and the multiple rating system, can all reduce the probability of corporate bond defaults, with the multiple rating system showing the best preventive effect against corporate bond defaults; (3) The dual rating system is more effective in promoting rating agencies to adjust rating behaviors, accurately correcting corporate bond ratings and effectively alleviating the issue of rating inflation. Competition among rating agencies intensifies rating shopping; (4) Under the dual rating system, rating agencies are more likely to expand the magnitude of credit rating upgrades and downgrades, enhancing the differentiation between high-quality corporate bonds and junk corporate bonds; (5) The selection of rating information from Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch can appropriately adjust the degree of flexibility or tightening in response to rating regulatory systems. Chengxin_Moody demonstrates a more sensitive reaction compared to Lianhe_Fitch regarding the rating regulatory systems. This study provides valuable references for the formulation and evaluation of the effectiveness of Chinese corporate bond rating regulatory policies.

Credit ratings, as one of the financial infrastructure elements, hold significant importance in ensuring the continuous healthy development of the bond market. However, there have been frequent occurrences of defaults in highly-rated corporate bonds in China, and the phenomena of rating inflation are apparent. In November 2020, state-owned enterprises such as Huachen Automotive Group and Yongmei Group faced unexpected defaults on AAA-rated bonds, revealing the problem of an inverse relationship between bond ratings and default rates. High-rated bond defaults have raised doubts in the market about the accuracy of rating results, leading to increased market volatility and posing systemic risk hazards. Inaccurate ratings exacerbate market information asymmetry, preventing the credit risk warning function that investors rely on from being effectively fulfilled, and may even trigger debt crises and systemic financial risks [1]. To promote the standardized development of the credit rating industry in the bond market, enhance the quality and competitiveness of credit ratings in China, and facilitate the better service of the credit rating industry to the healthy development of the bond market, the People\u2019s Bank of China and other six departments jointly issued the \u201cGuiding Opinions on Promoting the Reform, Opening-up, and High-Quality Development of Corporate Credit Bond Markets\u201d (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cOpinions\u201d) on August 17, 2021. Article 14 of the Opinions encourages issuers to choose active or investor-paid credit ratings, leveraging the cross-validation effects of dual ratings, multiple ratings, and different rating models. On August 6, 2021, the People\u2019s Bank of China, the National Development and Reform Commission, and five other departments jointly issued the \u201cNotice on Promoting the Healthy Development of the Credit Rating Industry in the Bond Market\u201d (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cNotice\u201d). The Notice came into effect on August 6, 2022. Article 10 of the Notice proposes to promote fair competition in the credit rating industry, encourage issuers to choose two or more credit rating agencies to conduct rating business and leverage the cross-validation effects of dual ratings, multiple ratings, and different rating modes. The release of the Notice has influenced the number of credit ratings for corporate bonds, shifting from single ratings to dual ratings and multiple ratings. As shown in S1 Table, the number of corporate bonds with multiple ratings rapidly increased in 2021, surpassing the number of corporate bonds with dual ratings for the first time. In June 2022, the number of corporate bonds with multiple ratings reached 8666, while the number of corporate bonds with dual ratings was 9568. In July of the same year, the number of corporate bonds with multiple ratings decreased to 7460, and the number of corporate bonds with dual ratings was 8880. It is evident that the Notice which encourages issuers to choose two or more credit rating agencies, has an incentive effect on the rating shopping behavior of issuers and the supervision of corporate bond ratings. This article will further investigates the impact of the implementation of the Notice on the effectiveness of dual ratings and multiple ratings. According to the Wind database, before the issuance of the Notice, 920 corporate bonds experienced defaults, among which 585 corporate bonds had a bond rating of AA or above, with a high default rate of 63.59%. When the Notice was released, 208 corporate bonds experienced default events, including 87 corporate bonds with a bond rating of AAA, AA+, or AA. Compared with before the issuance of the Notice, the default rate of high-rated corporate bonds has significantly decreased, indicating that the rating regulatory policies can reduce default events of high-rated bonds. Among 890 single-rated corporate bonds, 98 bonds defaulted after the issuance of the Notice. Among 93 dual-rated corporate bonds, 31 bonds defaulted after the issuance of the Notice. Among 143 multiple-rated corporate bonds, 57 bonds defaulted after the issuance of the Notice. This article will discuss whether dual ratings and multiple ratings can prevent corporate bond defaults to some extent. Jones et al. investigated the regulatory reform in the European credit rating industry and found that regulatory strengthening led to a shift in rating behavior towards conservatism, rather than an improvement in rating quality [2]. The information content of rating downgrades decreased, and the information content of rating upgrades increased. According to the Wind database, from 2014 to 2024, a total of 1531 corporate bonds experienced rating upgrades, and 409 corporate bonds experienced rating downgrades. From the issuance date of the Notice to January 2024, only 43 corporate bonds experienced rating upgrades, including 11 dual-rated bonds and 14 multiple-rated bonds. On the other hand, 67 corporate bonds experienced rating downgrades, including 37 dual-rated bonds and 2 multiple-rated bonds. The issuance of the Notice has significantly reduced the information of rating upgrades for corporate bonds in China, and dual ratings and multiple ratings have different effects on rating adjustments. This article will analyze and compare whether there is a significant difference between dual ratings and multiple ratings in the degree of adjustment for rating upgrades and downgrades of corporate bonds. Combining the above analysis, the reform of the rating industry regulatory systems has a considerable impact on the implementation of multiple ratings and the rating behaviors of corporate bonds. This article, starting from the perspective of the regulatory systems of corporate bond ratings in China, will explore the following questions: (1) Does the issuance of the Notice significantly affect the implementation of dual ratings and multiple ratings? (2) Can the issuance of the Notice, along with the dual rating system and the multiple rating system, effectively reduce the probability of corporate bond defaults? (3) Do the dual rating system and the multiple rating system have significant impacts on rating upgrades, rating downgrades, and the magnitude of credit rating changes for corporate bonds? The main structure of this article is as follows: Section 2 reviews relevant important literature. Section 3 introduces moderating variables and constructs a multivariate ordered Logit model. Section 4 empirically analyzes the three questions of this article using the multivariate ordered Logit model, and Section 5 discusses the implications of research results. 2",

Section 4 empirically analyzes the three questions of this article using the multivariate ordered Logit model, and Section 5 discusses the implications of research results. 2. Literature review Financial markets such as government bond market, stock market, sovereign debt, and corporate bonds emphasize the importance of credit risk assessment [3\u20135]. Most credit rating studies were based on the premise of rating shopping [6,7]. Characteristics of the rating shopping mechanism are: Issuers attempt to purchase ratings from candidate rating agencies that are more favorable for their own corporate bond issuance to reduce financing costs [8,9]. Rating shopping was an important assumption combined with the rating market structure, and it may led to conflicts of interests among rating agencies [10]. There is a close relationship between rating regulatory mechanisms and rating quality. Utilizing regulatory mechanisms can alleviate the problems of information asymmetry in financial markets. After the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, regulations in the use of multiple credit rating reduced the degree of rating inflation, which was related to the increased reliance of regulatory authorities on previously recorded ratings [11,12]. However, after regulatory authorities enacted relevant laws, increasing regulatory pressure on rating agencies had negative spillover effects on companies focusing on credit ratings [13]. Increased regulatory pressure on rating agencies weakened the trend of rating upgrades to gain market share [14]. Few studies have focused on the impact of regulatory systems in Chinese rating industry on the behaviors of rating agencies and rating inflation of corporate bonds. Scholars hold different opinions on the regulatory effects of dual rating systems and multiple rating systems. The dual rating system is beneficial for improving the differentiation of credit ratings. Gradually expanding the implementation scope of dual rating systems and promoting multiple rating mechanisms were conducive to improving rating rationality and hedging against risks of rating downgrades [15,16]. Multiple ratings had a beneficial effect on reducing IPO under-pricing and filing price corrections [17,18]. Kladakis et al. demonstrated that banks with more ratings could generate more liquidity. Issuing companies could convey more valid rating information to the market through multiple ratings to compensate for the information insufficiency and rating inaccuracies of a single credit rating [19,20]. Hanley et al. found that when multiple ratings were available, bonds were used the second-lowest credit rating for classification. However, some scholars believed that increased competition among rating agencies intensified rating shopping and triggered rating inflation [11,21,22]. Lee and Schantl demonstrated that increased competition among rating agencies led to better rating agencies releasing false rating information [23\u201325]. Existing research mainly focused on the regulatory effects of dual rating systems and multiple rating systems in other countries, and there was a lack of multidimensional perspective on rating changes, comparing the regulatory effects of dual rating systems and multiple rating systems on Chinese corporate bond ratings. Scholars have employed various methods such as artificial neural network model, deep learning, quantum forecast methods, deep neural decision trees, decision trees techniques to predict credit rating changes, the adequacy of macroeconomic policy against the risks and the effectiveness of regulation [26\u201331]. However, some scholars used ordered models to analyse rating changes based on the characteristics of credit rating indicators. Oliveira et al. considered the ordinal nature of credit ratings and used an ordered Logit model to discuss rating determinants [32]. Koerniadi used a fixed-effects regression model to examine the risk-taking behaviors after corporate rating downgrades [33]. Gu et al. studied rating agencies\u2019 adjustments to bond ratings after the Dodd-Frank reform, introducing \u201csoft adjustment\u201d indicators in a semi-parametric ordered model and quantifying it into bond-specific thresholds. This article refers to the above research, employing an ordered Logit model to empirically test the effectiveness of the Notice, dual rating system and multiple rating system [34]. In summary, previous studies provided a foundation for this study in terms of the effectiveness of rating regulatory mechanisms and rating methods, but there is still no exploration from the perspective of regulatory system reform in China\u2019s rating industry on the regulatory effects of dual rating and multiple rating systems on the rating inflation of corporate bonds and the behavior of rating agencies. this article explores the impact of the Notice, the dual rating system and the multiple rating system on rating agencies\u2019 behaviors and the alleviation of rating inflation from the perspectives of corporate bond defaults, rating upgrades, rating downgrades, the difference of rating upgrades, and the difference of rating downgrades in China. The following research hypotheses are proposed: (1) The issuance of the Notice has a significantly positive effect on the dual rating system and the multiple rating system. (2) The issuance of the Notice, the dual rating system, and the multiple rating system can reduce corporate bond defaults. (3) The dual rating system and the multiple rating system have significant effects on rating upgrades, downgrades, and the span of credit rating migrations. 3. Model construction Credit ratings are ordered qualitative indicators, and the traditional linear transformation theory of ratings has flaws. Due to the boundaries in rating symbols, estimation bias can occur even in large samples. Discrete choice models are not required the linear transformation of rating symbols. Instead, they directly transform rating symbols to various truncated intervals, effectively avoiding the issues associated with the linear transformation of ratings. Assuming a continuous unobservable latent variable and observable rating symbols y it , the ordered Logit model can be represented as: (1) In Eq (1), is explanatory variable that varies with individuals and time. is dummy variable. \u03b1 i represents heterogeneity of financial conditions among issuers. The distribution of error term \u03b5 it is independent of individuals and time. The ordered Logit model assumes the relationship between observable variable y it and continuous latent variable as follows: (2) In Eq (2), the number of cut-points c 1 ,c 2 ,\u2026,c 21 are determined by the number of categories of the observable variable y it . These cut-points are estimated by the maximum likelihood function. According to the properties of ordered Logit model, the distribution of observable variable y it is determined by the distribution of error term \u03b5 it . If the error term \u03b5 it follows the function of logistic cumulative distribution, it is expressed as: (3) In Eq (3), F(\u2022) represents the function of logistic cumulative distribution. 4. Data 4.1 Data selection and descriptive statistics In this study, data are collected from the Wind database covering the period from January 2014 to January 2024, totaling 10024 Chinese corporate bonds. Bonds with missing data are excluded, resulting in a sample of 9262 corporate bonds for analysis in S1 Data. The research period is set to the issuance of the Notice on August 6, 2021, comparing the effects of the dual rating systems and the multiple rating systems and examining the impact on corporate bond defaults before and after the issuance of the Notice. As shown in S2 and S3 Tables, we demonstrate descriptive statistical analysis of the data.Among issued after the publication of the Notice, corporate bonds are totaling 5375. 1720 bonds have dual ratings, and 1883 bonds have multiple ratings. Only 6 bonds default after the Notice issued. Corporate bond ratings range from AAA, AA+ to C, D, comprising a total of 22 grades. The ratings were assigned values from 1 for AAA to 22 for D in ascending order [11]. The implementation of rating regulatory policies affects rating upgrades and rating downgrades, as well as the migrations of ratings for corporate bonds. According to the sample data, 1385 corporate bonds experience rating upgrades, while 127 corporate bonds are rating downgrades. The magnitude of rating upgrades show a relatively small difference, whereas the downgrades exhibited a larger difference in migration. Chinese corporate bond ratings are provided by nine rating agencies, including Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch, as well as others like Dagong and Brilliance. Since 2006, Moody\u2019s has held a 49% stake in Chengxin_Moody. Fitch has held a 49% stake in Lianhe_Fitch since 2007. Other domestic rating agencies do not collaborate with international rating agencies. Due to differences in rating modes, accuracy, and reputation between domestic and international rating agencies, Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch can be selected as the second or the third rating agencies, leveraging the cross-validation role of dual ratings, multiple ratings, and different rating modes",

                  "content": ". 1720 bonds have dual ratings, and 1883 bonds have multiple ratings. Only 6 bonds default after the Notice issued. Corporate bond ratings range from AAA, AA+ to C, D, comprising a total of 22 grades. The ratings were assigned values from 1 for AAA to 22 for D in ascending order [11]. The implementation of rating regulatory policies affects rating upgrades and rating downgrades, as well as the migrations of ratings for corporate bonds. According to the sample data, 1385 corporate bonds experience rating upgrades, while 127 corporate bonds are rating downgrades. The magnitude of rating upgrades show a relatively small difference, whereas the downgrades exhibited a larger difference in migration. Chinese corporate bond ratings are provided by nine rating agencies, including Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch, as well as others like Dagong and Brilliance. Since 2006, Moody\u2019s has held a 49% stake in Chengxin_Moody. Fitch has held a 49% stake in Lianhe_Fitch since 2007. Other domestic rating agencies do not collaborate with international rating agencies. Due to differences in rating modes, accuracy, and reputation between domestic and international rating agencies, Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch can be selected as the second or the third rating agencies, leveraging the cross-validation role of dual ratings, multiple ratings, and different rating modes. According to the sample data, 1738 corporate bonds have dual ratings, with 516 bonds using Chengxin_Moody and 363 bonds using Lianhe_Fitch as the second rating. Additionally, 1893 corporate bonds have multiple ratings, with 554 bonds using Chengxin_Moody and 368 bonds using Lianhe_Fitch as the third rating. 4.2 Variable definitions Based on the three questions addressed in this study, dependent and independent variables are defined. The indicators and explanations for both dependent and independent variables are presented in S4 Table. Profitability, solvency, operational efficiency, and development capability of issuers are important factors influencing corporate bond ratings and regulatory changes [35]. In this study, we select indicators such as return on equity, debt-to-equity ratio, current ratio, inventory turnover rate and main business revenue growth rate for issuers from 2014 to 2024 as control variables to describe the financial heterogeneity of these firms. 5. Empirical analysis 5.1 Comparison of effects on the dual rating system and the multiple rating system after the publication of the notice To validate the effects of dual rating system and multiple rating system after the publication of the Notice, following the research approach of [11,24], this paper constructs an ordered Logit model. (4) (5) Eqs (4) and (5) can explain the impact of the Notice on the dual rating system and the multiple rating system. Here, and are latent variables representing whether there is a dual rating or a multiple rating, respectively. \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 are the estimated coefficients for the independent variables indicating the issuance of the Notice. \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 are the estimated coefficients for the dummy variables indicating whether rating agency is Chengxin_Moody or Lianhe_Fitch. \u03b1 j represents the estimated coefficients for the five financial indicators as control variables. The error terms \u03b5 1t and \u03b5 2t follow the function of logistic cumulative distribution. As shown in S5 Table, the issuance of the Notice has a significantly positive impact on the implementation of both the dual rating system and the multiple rating system, with a greater effect on the implementation of the multiple rating system. The ratings provided by Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch have a significantly positive effect on the implementation of both the dual rating system and the multiple rating system. The financial conditions of the issuers exhibit significant differences in the implementation of the rating regulatory systems. The net return on equity, current ratio, and main business revenue growth rate have negative impact on the dual rating system. The current ratio, inventory turnover rate, and main business revenue growth rate have negative impact on the multiple rating system. 5.2 Comparison of the impact of the notice, dual rating system, multiple rating system on corporate bond defaults To compare the impact of the notice, the dual rating system and the multiple rating system on corporate bond defaults, an ordered Logit model is constructed in this study. (6) (7) (8) Eqs (6)\u2013(8) can analyze the impact of the Notice, the dual rating system and the multiple rating system on reducing the probability of corporate bond defaults. Here, is the latent variable representing whether defaults occur on corporate bonds. \u03b2 3 , \u03b2 4 and \u03b2 5 are the estimated coefficients for the independent variables indicating whether the Notice is issued, whether there are dual ratings, and whether there are multiple ratings, respectively. \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 are the estimated coefficients for the dummy variables indicating whether rating agency is Chengxin_Moody or Lianhe_Fitch. \u03b1 j represents the estimated coefficients for the control variables, which include five financial indicators. The error terms \u03b5 3t , \u03b5 4t and \u03b5 5t follow the functions of logistic cumulative distribution. As shown in S6 Table, the estimated coefficients for whether the Notice is issued, whether there are dual ratings, and whether there are multiple ratings are all negative. Through calculations, the issuance of the notice, the dual rating system, and the multiple rating system result in corporate bond default probabilities of 0.0335 ( ), 0.1559 ( ), and 0 ( ), respectively. This indicates that the issuance of rating regulatory systems can prevent corporate bond defaults. The Notice has a significantly negative impact on corporate bond defaults, and the multiple rating system is the most effective in preventing corporate bond defaults. The estimated coefficients for whether bonds rated by Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch are both negative, suggesting that the selection of rating information from Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch can reduce the probability of corporate bond defaults to zero, but the impacts are not significant. 5.3 Comparison of the impact of dual ratings on corporate bond rating upgrades, downgrades, and credit grade migrations Due to different rating models of Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch compared to other domestic rating agencies, selecting information from Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch as the second or third rating provides a cross-validation effect. Based on the research of [11], to examine the influence of the dual rating system on rating upgrades, downgrades, and credit grade migrations, and considering the moderating effects of different rating agencies on the rating changes of corporate bonds, two adjusting variables are introduced: Chengxin_Moody * Dual ratings and Lianhe_Fitch * Dual ratings. A new ordered Logit model is constructed to analyze rating information from Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch strengthens or weakens the impact of the dual rating system on corporate bond rating changes. (9) (10) (11) Eq (9) describes the direct impact of the dual rating system on corporate bond rating upgrades or downgrades, as well as the differences in rating upgrades or downgrades. Eqs (10) and (11) further examine the moderating effect of Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch on corporate bond rating changes. Here, is the latent variable representing whether the corporate bond rating is upgraded or downgraded, and the differences in rating upgrades or downgrades. \u03b2 6 , \u03b2 7 and \u03b2 8 are the estimated coefficients for the independent variables indicating whether there are dual ratings. \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 , \u03bb 3 , \u03bb 4 are the estimated coefficients of dummy variables indicating whether rating agency is Chengxin_Moody or Lianhe_Fitch, Chengxin_Moody * Dual ratings and Lianhe_Fitch * Dual ratings, respectively. \u03b1 j represent the estimated coefficients of five financial indicator control variables.The error terms \u03b5 6t , \u03b5 7t and \u03b5 8t follow the functions of logistic cumulative distribution. 5.3.1 The impact of dual rating system on corporate bond rating upgrades As shown in S7 Table, the dual rating system has a significant negative impact on corporate bond rating upgrades, indicating that the dual rating system can correct inflated ratings for Chinese corporate bonds, alleviating the issue of rating inflation. Ratings provided by Chengxin_Moody as the second rating has a significantly negative impact on rating upgrades, while ratings provided by Lianhe_Fitch has a significantly positive effect on rating upgrades. This suggests that the choices of different rating agencies by issuers have varying effects on the rating upgrades of corporate bonds. Chengxin_Moody is more cautious in releasing rating upgrades. The debt-to-equity ratio has a significantly negative impact on rating upgrades, while other control variables do not have significant impacts on rating upgrades. Based on the estimated coefficients of the adjusting variables in S7 Table, the coefficient for Chengxin_Moody * dual ratings is -0.2730, and the coefficient for Lianhe_Fitch * dual ratings is -0.0095. This indicates that rating information provided by Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch strengthens the negative relationship between the dual rating system and corporate bond rating upgrades. 5.3.2 The impact of dual rating system on corporate bond rating downgrades As shown in S8 Table, the dual rating system has a significant positive effect on rating downgrades of corporate bonds, indicating that the dual rating system makes it easier for rating agencies to downgrade corporate bond ratings",

Rating information provided by Chengxin_Moody as the second rating has a significantly negative impact on rating downgrades, while the impact of Lianhe_Fitch\u2019s information on rating downgrades is not significant, indicating that Chengxin_Moody is more cautious in releasing rating downgrades than Lianhe_Fitch. The return on equity and the current ratio have significantly negative impacts on rating downgrades, while the debt-to-equity ratio has a significantly positive effect on rating downgrades. The inventory turnover rate has no significant impact on rating downgrades. After adding the adjusting variables, the main business revenue growth rate has a significantly negative impact on rating downgrades. According to the estimated coefficients of the adjusting variables in S8 Table, the coefficient for Chengxin_Moody * Dual ratings is 1.3505, and the coefficient for Lianhe_Fitch * Dual ratings is 0.3006. This indicates that rating information provided by Chengxin_Moody has a significantly promoting effect on positive relationship between the dual rating system and corporate bond rating downgrades, while the impact of Lianhe_Fitch\u2019s rating information on positive relationship between the dual rating system and corporate bond rating downgrades is not significant. 5.3.3 The impact of dual rating system on the difference of rating upgrades As shown in S9 Table, the dual rating system has a significantly positive effect on the difference of rating upgrades. This indicates that the dual rating system encourages rating agencies to more easily increase the range of credit rating upgrades. Rating information provided by Chengxin_Moody has a significantly positive effect on the difference of rating upgrades, while rating information provided by Lianhe_Fitch has a negative impact on the difference of rating upgrades, suggesting that Chengxin_Moody is more likely to increase the amplitude of credit rating upgrades. The debt-to-equity ratio has a significantly positive effect on the difference of rating upgrades, while other control variables have no significant impact on the difference of rating upgrades. According to the estimated coefficients of adjusting variables in S9 Table, the coefficient of Chengxin_Moody * Dual ratings is 0.2860, and the coefficient of Lianhe_Fitch * Dual ratings is -0.0157. This indicates that rating information provided by Chengxin_Moody strengthens positive relationship between the dual rating system and the difference of rating upgrades. On the other hand, rating information provided by Lianhe_Fitch weakens positive relationship between the dual rating system and the difference of rating upgrades. 5.3.4 The impact of dual rating system on the difference of rating downgrades As shown in S10 Table, the dual rating system has a significant positive effect on the difference of rating downgrades. This indicates that the dual rating system encourages rating agencies to increase the span of credit rating downgrades more easily. Rating information provided by Chengxin_Moody has a significantly negative impact on the difference of rating downgrades, while the impact of rating information provided by Lianhe_Fitch is not significant. This suggests that Chengxin_Moody is more cautious in increasing the magnitude of credit rating downgrades. The return on equity, the main business revenue growth rate, and the current ratio have significantly negative impacts on the difference of rating downgrades, while the asset-liability ratio has a significantly positive impact, and inventory turnover has no significant impact on the difference of rating downgrades. According to the estimated coefficients of the adjusting variables in S10 Table, the coefficient for Chengxin_Moody * dual ratings is 1.5711, and Lianhe_Fitch * dual ratings is 0.2646. This indicates that rating information provided by Chengxin_Moody has a significantly strengthening effect on positive relationship between the dual rating system and the difference of rating downgrades. However, the moderating effect of rating information provided by Lianhe_Fitch on positive relationship between the dual rating system and the difference of rating downgrades is not significant. 5.4 Comparison of the impact of multiple credit ratings on ratings upgrades, rating downgrades, and credit grade migrations of corporate bonds Similarly, introducing two adjusting variables, namely, Chengxin_Moody * multiple ratings and Lianhe_Fitch * multiple ratings. We constructing a new ordered Logit model to analyze whether rating information provided by Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch as the third rating to strengthen or weaken the impact of the multiple credit rating system on the rating changes of corporate bonds. (12) (13) (14) Eq (12) describes the direct impact of the multiple credit rating system on rating upgrades and rating downgrades of corporate bonds, as well as the difference of rating upgrades and downgrades. Eqs (13) and (14) further verify the moderating effects on Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch rating agencies\u2019 rating changes. Here, is the latent variable, representing whether corporate bond ratings are upgraded or downgraded, and the difference of rating upgrades and downgrades. \u03b2 9 , \u03b2 10 and \u03b2 11 are the estimated coefficients for whether there is a multiple credit rating. \u03bb 1 to \u03bb 4 are the estimated coefficients for the dummy variables, including whether rating agency is Chengxin_Moody or Lianhe_Fitch, Chengxin_Moody *Multiple ratings and Lianhe_Fitch * Multiple ratings, respectively. \u03b1 j are the estimated coefficients for the control variables representing five financial indicators. The error terms \u03b5 9t , \u03b5 10t and \u03b5 11t follow the functions of Logistic cumulative distribution. 5.4.1 The impact of multiple credit rating system on rating upgrades. As shown in S11 Table, the multiple credit rating system has a significant negative impact on rating upgrades, indicating that the multiple rating system still alleviates the issue of rating inflation. Rating information provided by Chengxin_Moody as the third rating has a significantly negative impact on the rating upgrades, while the positive effect of rating information provided by Lianhe_Fitch on rating upgrades is not significant, suggesting that Chengxin_Moody is more cautious in releasing rating upgrades. The debt-to-equity ratio has a significantly negative impact on the rating upgrades, and the impact of other control variables on the rating upgrades is not significant. Based on the estimated coefficients of adjusting variables in S11 Table, the coefficient for Chengxin_Moody * Multiple ratings is 0.0978, and the coefficient for Lianhe_Fitch *Multiple ratings is -0.2679. This indicates that rating information provided by Chengxin_Moody weakens the negative relationship between the multiple rating system and rating upgrades of corporate bond ratings, while rating information provided by Lianhe_Fitch strengthens the negative relationship between the multiple rating system and rating upgrades. After incorporating the adjusting variables, the positive impact of rating information provided by Lianhe_Fitch on the rating upgrades becomes significant, suggesting that considering the interaction between Lianhe_Fitch and the multiple rating system, competition among rating agencies makes Lianhe_Fitch more likely to inflate ratings, catering to the rating shopping behavior of bond issuers. 5.4.2 The impact of multiple rating system on rating downgrades. As shown in S12 Table, the multiple rating system has a significantly negative impact on rating downgrades of corporate bond ratings. This indicates that the multiple rating system promotes rating agencies to be more cautious in downgrading corporate bond ratings. Both rating information provided by Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch have negative impacts on rating downgrades, but the effects are not significant. The return on equity, the current ratio, and the main business revenue growth rate have significantly negative impacts on rating downgrades, while the debt-to-equity ratio has a significantly positive impact, and the inventory turnover rate has no significant impact on rating downgrades. According to the estimated coefficients of adjusting variables in S12 Table, the coefficient for Chengxin_Moody * Multiple ratings is 0.5741, and the coefficient for Lianhe_Fitch * Multiple ratings is 2.3115. This indicates that rating information provided by Lianhe_Fitch significantly weakens positive relationship between the multiple rating system and rating downgrades of corporate bond ratings.

However, the impact of Chengxin_Moody\u2019s rating information on the relationship between the multiple rating system and rating downgrades of corporate bond ratings is not significant. 5.4.3 The impact of multiple rating system on the difference of rating upgrades. As shown in S13 Table, the multiple rating system has a significant positive effect on the difference of corporate bond rating upgrades, indicating that the multiple rating system encourages rating agencies to more easily enhance the span of credit rating upgrades. Rating information provided by Chengxin_Moody has a significantly positive effect on the difference of rating upgrades, while rating information provided by Lianhe_Fitch has a negative impact on the difference of rating upgrades, suggesting that Chengxin_Moody is more likely to increase the magnitude of credit rating upgrades. The debt-to-equity ratio has a significantly positive effect on the the difference of rating upgrades, and the effects of other control variables on the difference of rating upgrades are not significant. Based on the estimated coefficients of adjusting variables in S13 Table, the coefficient for Chengxin_Moody * Multiple ratings is -0.0362, and the coefficient for Lianhe_Fitch * Multiple ratings is 0.3310. This indicates that rating information provided by Chengxin_Moody weakens positive relationship between the dual rating system and the difference of rating upgrades, while rating information provided by Lianhe_Fitch strengthens positive relationship between the dual rating mechanism and the difference of rating upgrades. After incorporating the adjusting variables, the negative impact of Lianhe_Fitch\u2019s rating information on the difference of rating upgrades becomes significant, suggesting that considering the interaction between Lianhe_Fitch and the multiple rating system, the rating regulatory systems encourage Lianhe_Fitch to be more cautious in increasing the magnitude of credit rating upgrades. 5.4.4 The impact of multiple rating system on the difference of rating downgrades. As shown in S14 Table, the multiple rating system has a significantly negative impact on the difference of rating downgrades. This indicates that the multiple rating system encourages rating agencies to be more cautious in increasing the span of credit rating downgrades. Both Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch releasing rating information exhibit negative effects on the difference of rating downgrades, although these effects are not statistically significant. The return on equity and the main business revenue growth rate have significantly negative impacts on the the difference of rating downgrades, while the debt-to-equity ratio has a significantly positive impact. The effects of the current ratio and the inventory turnover ratio on the difference of rating downgrades are not statistically significant. Based on the estimated coefficients of adjusting variables in S14 Table, the coefficient for Chengxin_Moody * Multiple ratings is 0.5587, and the coefficient for Lianhe_Fitch * Multiple ratings is 2.2562. This suggests that rating information provided by Lianhe_Fitch significantly strengthens the negative relationship between the multiple rating system and the difference of rating downgrades. However, the interaction effect of rating information provided by Chengxin_Moody has the negative relationship between the multiple rating system and the difference of rating downgrades is not statistically significant. 5.5 Empirical comparison of dual rating system and multiple rating system on corporate bond rating changes According to empirical analysis based on the results of S7 and S10 Tables, the results reveal that the dual rating system has a greater negative impact on rating upgrades, indicating that the dual rating system is more effective in mitigating the issue of inflated ratings. Under the dual rating system, both Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch significantly have influence on rating upgrades, while the impact of Lianhe_Fitch on rating upgrades is not significant under the multiple rating system. This suggests that competition among multiple rating agencies weakens the publication of Lianhe_Fitch\u2019s ratings, making the dual rating system more favorable for Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch to adjust their rating behaviors. Considering the interaction among Chengxin_Moody, Lianhe_Fitch, the dual rating system, and the multiple rating system, the publication of Chengxin_Moody\u2019s ratings have a restraining effect on the negative relationship between the multiple rating system and rating upgrades, indicating that competition among multiple rating agencies leads Chengxin_Moody to issue ratings that cater to the rating shopping behaviors of bond issuers. Due to S8 and S12 Tables, the dual rating system has a significantly positive effect on rating downgrades, while the multiple rating system has a significantly negative impact on rating downgrades. This implies that under the dual rating system, rating agencies are more likely to downgrade ratings, but under the multiple rating system, rating agencies are more cautious about rating downgrades. Under different rating regulatory systems, both Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch have negative impacts on rating downgrades. Only under the dual rating system, the negative impact of Chengxin_Moody on rating downgrades is significant. Including the moderating variables, Chengxin_Moody\u2019s ratings have inhibiting effects on the positive relationship between the dual rating system and rating downgrades, while Lianhe_Fitch\u2019s ratings weaken the negative relationship between the multiple rating system and rating downgrades. This indicates that purchasing ratings provided by Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch can appropriately adjust the looseness or tightness of the rating regulatory systems regarding rating downgrades. S9 and S13 Tables reveal that the dual rating system has a significantly greater positive effect on the difference of rating upgrades, indicating that under the dual rating system, rating agencies are more likely to expand the magnitude of credit rating upgrades, causing a gap between high-quality and junk corporate bonds to widen. Under different rating regulatory systems, Chengxin_Moody has a significantly positive effect on the difference of rating upgrades, while the impact of Lianhe_Fitch on the difference of rating upgrades is not significant. This suggests that Chengxin_Moody is more sensitive to reactions of the rating regulatory systems. With the inclusion of moderating variables, the positive correlation between Chengxin_Moody and the difference of rating upgrades under the dual rating system is strengthened, and the positive correlation under the multiple rating system is weakened. Meanwhile, the positive correlation between Lianhe_Fitch and the difference of rating upgrades under the dual rating system is weakened, and the positive correlation under the multiple rating system is strengthened. The above research indicates that under the dual rating system, purchasing Chengxin_Moody ratings is more likely to expand the magnitude of rating upgrades, while under the multiple rating system, purchasing ratings of Chengxin_Moody is more conservative in increasing the difference of rating upgrades. Under different rating regulatory systems, the difference of rating upgrades of Lianhe_Fitch is opposite to that of Chengxin_Moody. As shown in S10 and S14 Tables, the dual rating system has a significantly positive effect on the difference of rating downgrades, while the multiple rating system has a significantly negative impact on the difference of rating downgrades. This indicates that under the dual rating system, rating agencies are more likely to increase the magnitude of credit rating downgrades, while under the multiple rating system, rating agencies are more cautious in expanding the magnitude of credit rating downgrades. Under the dual rating system, Chengxin_Moody has a significantly negative impact on the difference of rating downgrades, while the impact of Lianhe_Fitch on the difference of rating downgrades is not significant. This suggests that Chengxin_Moody is more conservative in changing the magnitude of rating downgrades. Under the multiple rating system, both Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch do not significantly impact the the difference of rating downgrades. Including adjusting variables, the positive correlation between Chengxin_Moody and the difference of rating downgrades under the dual rating system is significantly enhanced, while the positive correlation between Lianhe_Fitch and the difference of rating downgrades under the multiple rating system is significantly weakened. This indicates that purchasing ratings of Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch can appropriately adjust the impact of the rating regulatory systems on the magnitude of rating downgrades. 5.6 Robustness test To demonstrate the robustness of empirical results, this study uses a controlled ordered Logit model including no control variables and adjusting variables to directly verify the impact of the Notice on the dual rating system and multiple rating system, the impact of the rating regulatory systems on corporate bond defaults, and the effects of the dual-rating system and multiple rating system on rating upgrades, rating downgrades, the magnitude of rating upgrades, and the magnitude of rating downgrades",

Comparing the empirical results in S15 Table and S5 Table to S14 Table, although the estimated coefficients for the variables of the Notice, the dual rating system and the multiple rating system are changed when control variables and adjusting variables are removed, but the signs and significance levels remain unchanged. This indicates the robustness of empirical results from S5 Table to S14 Table. 6. Conclusions This study focuses on the rating inflation of Chinese corporate bonds. Centered around the effects of financial regulatory reforms in the bond market, we propose and address three research questions. Considering the practical situations of the credit rating industry in China and the interaction between Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch with the dual-rating system and multi-rating system, we construct a new ordered Logit model. We attempt to explore the impact of the Notice, the dual-rating system, and the multi-rating system on the probability of corporate bond defaults, rating upgrades, rating downgrades and the magnitude of credit rating changes. The following conclusions are drawn: Firstly, The issuance of the Notice has a significantly positive effect on the implementation of both the dual-rating system and the multi-rating system, with a greater influence on the latter. The Notice, along with the dual-rating and multi-rating systems, can reduce the probability of corporate bond defaults. The Notice has a significant effect on preventing corporate bond defaults, and the multi-rating system performs the best in preventing such defaults. Secondly, Both the dual-rating system and the multi-rating system have a significantly negative impact on rating upgrades, with the dual-rating system having a greater negative influence. This indicates that the dual-rating system is more effective in correcting corporate bond ratings and mitigating rating inflation. Under the dual-rating system, Chengxin_Moody has a significantly negative impact on rating upgrades, while Lianhe_Fitch has a significantly positive effect. Under the multi-rating system, Chengxin_Moody has a significantly negative impact on rating upgrades, whereas positive effect of Lianhe_Fitch on rating upgrades is not significant. This suggests that competition among multiple rating agencies weakens rating information provided by Lianhe_Fitch, and the dual-rating system is more favorable for Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch to adjust their rating behaviors. Chengxin_Moody is more cautious in rating upgrades. Considering the interaction between Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch with the dual-rating system and the multi-rating system, competition among multiple rating agencies leads to increased rating shopping behaviors. The ratings provided by Chengxin_Moody have a significantly strengthening effect on rating downgrades under the dual-rating system. Thirdly, The dual-rating system has a significantly positive effect on rating downgrades, while the multi-rating system has a significantly negative impact. This implies that under the dual-rating system, rating agencies are more likely to decrease ratings, but under the multi-rating system, rating agencies are more cautious in rating downgrades. Under the dual-rating system, Chengxin_Moody has a significantly negative impact on rating downgrades, indicating that the dual-rating system has a regulatory effect on rating information. There are significant differences in the moderating effects of Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch on the relationship between different rating regulatory systems and rating downgrades. This suggests that selecting rating information of Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch can appropriately adjust the looseness or tightness of the impact of rating regulatory systems on rating downgrades. Fourthly, Both the dual-rating system and the multi-rating system have a significantly positive effect on the difference of rating upgrade, with the dual-rating system having a greater positive effect. This indicates that under the dual-rating system, rating agencies are more likely to increase the magnitude of credit rating upgrades, enhancing the differentiation between high-quality and junk corporate bonds. Chengxin_Moody is more sensitive to rating changes in regulatory systems than Lianhe_Fitch. Under different rating regulatory systems, Lianhe_Fitch moderates the changes in the behaviors of the difference of rating upgrade compared to Chengxin_Moody. Fifthly, The dual-rating system has a significantly positive effect on the difference of rating downgrade, while the multi-rating system has a significantly negative impact. This implies that under the dual-rating system, rating agencies are more likely to increase the magnitude of rating downgrades, but under the multi-rating system, rating agencies are more cautious in expanding the magnitude of credit rating downgrades. Chengxin_Moody is more conservative in the difference of rating downgrades. Selecting rating information of Chengxin_Moody and Lianhe_Fitch can appropriately adjust the impact of rating regulatory systems on the magnitude of rating downgrades.",

                  "content": "Skeptical Science New Research for Week #46 2024 Posted on 14 November 2024 by Doug Bostrom, Marc Kodack Open access notables Microbial solutions must be deployed against climate catastrophe, Peixoto et al., Nature Communications [comment]: The climate crisis is escalating. A multitude of microbe-based solutions have been proposed, and these technologies hold great promise and could be deployed along with other climate mitigation strategies. However, these solutions have not been deployed effectively at scale. To reverse this inaction, collaborators across different sectors are needed \u2014 from industry, funders and policymakers \u2014 to coordinate their widespread deployment with the goal of avoiding climate catastrophe. This collective call from joint scientific societies, institutions, editors and publishers, requests that the global community and governments take immediate and decisive emergency action, while also proposing a clear and effective framework for deploying these solutions at scale. Irreversible changes in the sea surface temperature threshold for tropical convection to CO 2 forcing, Park et al., Communications Earth & Environment: Cave air temperatures in four caves in the European Alps show statistically significant warming trends of about 0.2 \u00b0C per decade over the last two decades (2000\u20132020). These trends are about half as large as those observed outside and are characterized by a remarkable spatial and temporal consistency. The investigated caves represent different types in terms of their ventilation regime and one of them also hosts perennial ice. Key observation sites are located in cave sections where the temporal variability of air temperature is strongly attenuated compared to outside conditions and data from different cave sections show that the main results are valid for large parts of the investigated caves. Continued warming will lead to broad changes in alpine cave environments, including changes in strength and direction of air flow in caves, karst hydrology and subsurface ecosystems. The observed subsurface warming has a particular strong effect on the long-term preservation of perennial ice present in some of these caves. This is shown for an ice cave in the Austrian Alps, where enhanced melt of ice correlates with the observed warming. This cave (and similar ones) will not be able to hold perennial ice beyond the next decade. Ross Ice Shelf frontal zone subjected to increasing melting by ocean surface waters, Sheehan & Heywood, Science Advances: Solar-warmed surface waters subduct beneath Antarctica\u2019s ice shelves as a result of wind forcing, but this process is poorly observed and its interannual variability is yet to be assessed. We observe a 50-meter-thick intrusion of warm surface water immediately beneath the Ross Ice Shelf. Temperature in the uppermost 5 meters decreases toward the ice base in near-perfect agreement with an exponential fit, consistent with the loss of heat to the overlying ice. Ekman forcing drives a heat transport into the cavity sufficient to contribute considerably to near-front melting; this transport has increased over the past four decades, driven by the increasing heat content of the ice-front polynya. Climate change terminology does not influence willingness to take climate action, Goldwert et al., Journal of Environmental Psychology: Despite widespread concern about climate change, a majority of people are not engaging in climate actions necessary to help decrease the risks posed by global warming. Many practitioners and scholars have argued that the climate change terminology can be leveraged to elicit distinct reactions. However, the results of different climate change terms have been mixed. The current research addresses this ongoing debate by directly testing the impact of climate terminology. Across two experiments (Ntotal=6,132, recruited globally in 63 countries in Experiment 1, and a replication in the US in Experiment 2), we explored whether climate terminology influenced the extent to which individuals were willing to engage in preventative action. We tested the differential effect of 10 frequently used terms (i.e., \u201cclimate change\u201d, \u201cclimate crisis\u201d, \u201cglobal warming\u201d, \u201cglobal heating\u201d, \u201cclimate emergency\u201d, \u201ccarbon pollution\u201d, \u201ccarbon emissions\u201d, \u201cgreenhouse gasses\u201d, \u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d, \u201cglobal boiling\u201d). Despite high willingness to engage in climate action (74% in Experiment 1 and 57% in Experiment 2), the terms had no impact on intentions to act. Bayesian ANOVAs strongly supported the null hypothesis in both studies. This pattern of null results was robust across a wide variety of populations (including age, gender, political ideology, socioeconomic status, and education level), as well as across numerous psychological and cultural variables. Our null results suggest that subtle differences in climate change language are not a barrier to climate action, indicating that focusing on subtle terminology in climate messaging is not an effective use of resources. Harnessing oil and gas superprofits for climate action, Egli et al., Climate Policy: Climate change disproportionately harms low-income countries, whilst international climate finance to support them remains inadequate. Negotiations about the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) centre around how to cover increasing needs of developing countries. Windfall profits of the fossil fuel industry, which benefits from this dominant source of greenhouse gas emissions, could contribute to mobilizing more finance, both for the NCQG and wider needs of domestic and international climate finance. We find that the energy crisis of 2022 led to oil and gas industry \u2018superprofits\u2019 in the same year \u2013 defined as being above the stated expectations at the beginning of the year \u2013 amounting to about half a trillion dollars (US$490 bn above the $753 bn projected by the companies). Over $200 bn of this accrued to companies directly controlled by governments, two-thirds of which do not have a historical commitment to contribute to international climate finance. The remaining $280 bn of superprofits went to privately controlled companies, of which over 95% are headquartered in countries currently contributing to international climate finance. We argue that there is a clear case to include fossil fuel profits on the agenda of UNFCCC climate finance negotiations and to pursue an international agreement on minimum fossil fuel production taxes. Given that most privately controlled superprofits occurred in G20 countries and the group's ability to reach agreement on corporation taxes recently, the G20 could be a natural forum to pursue such policy action. From this week's government and NGO section: Extreme Weather, Extreme Content: How Big Tech Enables Climate Disinformation In a World on the Brink, Climate Action Against Disinformation The authors present three new case studies that provide a snapshot into the online world of English-language climate disinformation. The key findings from the report include opposition to renewables\u2014despite having years to clean up their platforms, Big Tech continues to allow a small number of \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d to pollute their platforms with debunked claims attacking renewable energy and electric vehicles; weaponizing wildfires-disinformation operations are exploiting extreme weather events to fuel opposition to climate policies, and recently, have led to threats of violence against emergency response personnel; and fossil fuel advertising on Meta-fossil fuel companies continue to use digital advertising to launder their image. The Educator's Guide to Climate Emotions, Carolyn McGrath and Kate Schapira, Climate Psychology Alliance of North America The climate crisis is profoundly impacting the emotional well-being of young people. While teaching about the causes, consequences, and responses to global warming, K-12 educators can create space for students to identify, understand, and express their feelings about living through a time of rapid environmental change. The authors offer suggestions for age-appropriate pedagogical approaches, cross-disciplinary teaching methods, as well as opportunities for collective action and collaboration. The guide highlights the transformative potential of incorporating emotions in climate education to foster a sense of agency, efficacy, and purpose among students. The Teacher-Friendly Guide to Climate Change, Zabel et al, Paleontological Research Institution The guide includes both the basics of climate change science and perspectives on teaching a subject that has become socially and politically polarized. The focus audience is high school Earth science and environmental science teachers, and it is written with an eye toward the kind of information and graphics that a secondary school teacher might need in the classroom",

                  "content": ". In many ways, New Zealand\u2019s legislative, public accountability, and management structures are a strength of its response to climate change. In particular, New Zealand has a comprehensive legislative framework and institutional arrangements that provide a structure to develop policies and plans for setting and meeting emissions reduction targets and for identifying and responding to climate change risks. There are clear roles and responsibilities for public organizations to lead, coordinate, contribute to, and monitor the Government\u2019s actions in response to climate change. There is also comprehensive and transparent reporting at a high level about the effectiveness of those actions and the progress being made. However, New Zealand did not rate as highly in other areas. For example, some parts of local government actively engage with the central government on climate change mitigation and adaptation through membership institutions Local Government New Zealand and Taituar? \u2013 Local Government Professionals Aotearoa. However,there is no formal mechanisms that would enable local and central government organizations to jointly create and implement policies related to climate change Accelerating Offshore Wind: Developing a regional ecosystem monitoring programme for the UK offshore wind industry, Simon Cheeseman, ORE Catapult One of the major challenges facing the offshore renewable energy industry is how to deliver the speed and extent of the dramatic increase in offshore wind deployment needed to meet the UK\u2019s Net Zero targets. The author introduces an alternative monitoring approach for the offshore wind industry. There is a need to take advantage of innovative technologies to better understand the functioning of the UK marine ecosystems within which large-scale offshore wind deployment is situated. There needs to be a collaborative effort to enable a transformation in data gathering driven by a regional ecosystem-based monitoring programme (REMP) supported by new technologies that can be confidently incorporated into impact assessments and future monitoring plans. By implementing a regional monitoring programme, a more coherent and cohesive approach across multiple sites can deliver targeted monitoring that enables the cumulative effects to be more accurately assessed. Facilitating Equity-Oriented Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Investments, Kasia Dahlbeck and Ted Lamm, UC Berkeley School of Law, Center ofr Law, Energy & the Environment The emerging California and U.S. policy context provides an opportunity to design needed electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure plans in a manner that advances local economic prosperity and environmental justice. The authors present three strategies for local governments and community-based organizations seeking to design equity-oriented EV infrastructure investments, including community oversight councils, Community Benefits Agreements, and participatory budgeting processes. These measures are explored through multiple case studies and presented alongside additional tools for equity-oriented project design to inform local jurisdiction-scale electric vehicle supply equipment development. Lighting the Path: Meeting North Carolina\u2019s Coming Energy Needs, Lewis et al., The John Locke Foundation The authors estimate how much energy infrastructure North Carolina would need to satisfy a recent state law requiring carbon neutrality by 2050. The authors propose two paths: a Renewable Scenario and a Nuclear Scenario. The new solar facilities needed under the Renewable Scenario would take up more land than the state\u2019s 13 biggest cities combined and would require a whopping 12,500 miles of new transmission lines to be built out to them, the costs of which would be passed on to consumers. By contrast, the Nuclear Scenario would require only about 1,348 miles of new transmission lines (a 7 percent increase). Being that nuclear is highly reliable and vastly more efficient in land use, new nuclear generation would need less than half of the amount of land currently taken by intermittent solar facilities. The Struggle for a Just Energy Transition in a Turbulent World Order, Osamah Alsayegh, Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy The endeavors toward a global just energy transition\u2014ensuring the shift from high to near-zero emission energy system that reduces existing social inequalities and promotes inclusivity, poverty reduction, improved access to affordable energy and fairness\u2014face multiple challenges of the present world-order dynamics. The economic pressures of inflation and debts on the global South, rising competition between the world's power rivals creating subsidized domestic clean technologies supply chains, and unsteady commitments of the world\u2019s leading nations toward environmental commitments are the main obstacles slowing the progress of a global transition and poor governance and regulatory environments in many developing nations. Linkages between WASH, climate change, food security and ecosystems / nature?based solutions, Lankford et al., WaterAid Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), climate change, food security, and ecosystems are all deeply interconnected within a larger complex system. As the interlinked challenges of climate change, food security, and ecosystem sustainability become increasingly urgent, the role of WASH in fostering resilient communities and ecosystems cannot be overstated. The authors explore the linkages with and the impacts WASH has on three domains: climate resilience, food security, and healthy ecosystems including nature-based solutions). Climate- and Environmentally Based Information Activities by PRC and Russian Media, Una Aleksandra B?rzi?a-?erenkova, and Tanya Lim, NATO Strategic Communication Center of Excellence Russia and China have leveraged the 21st-century media landscape, including but not limited to PRC and Russian state-affiliated media outlets, to expose the global public to their strategic narratives, whether it is fostering anti-NATO sentiment or portraying themselves as climate champions. To safeguard the international information space in NATO nations and beyond, it is crucial to research, map, compare, and expose the climate and environment-related narratives propagated by PRC and Russian media. By understanding how these narratives are constructed and disseminated, we can better counter their influence and foster a more informed public. Building Sustainable Futures: Advancing Climate Resilience in South Asia, Farwa Aamer, Asia Society South Asia\u2019s climate vulnerabilities are severely compromising the region\u2019s socioeconomic stability. The impacts of climate change are particularly pronounced in the interlinked sectors of water, food, and energy \u2014 all of which are essential for economic and human development but increasingly strained by climate pressures. There is an urgent need to address these challenges with an integrated, systems-based approach as the region\u2019s historical means of managing them in silos are no longer sustainable. To build resilience, South Asian countries must prioritize cross-sectoral collaboration, strengthen governance mechanisms, and develop institutions capable of managing these critical resources more effectively. COP29 special report on climate change and health: Health is the argument for climate action, Issa et al., World Health Organization WHO urges world leaders at COP29 to abandon the siloed approach to addressing climate change and health. It stresses the importance of positioning health at the core of all climate negotiations, strategies, policies, and action plans, to save lives and secure healthier futures for present and future generations. Developed by WHO in collaboration with over 100 organizations and 300 experts the report identifies critical policies across three integrated dimensions \u2013 people, place, and planet. The authors outline key actions aiming to protect all people, particularly the estimated 3.6 billion people who live in areas that are most susceptible to climate change. Broad public concern about climate change in Israel crosses political lines, Yossi David and Avner Gross, at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev An overwhelming majority of the Israeli public is concerned about climate change. Concern about climate change crosses political lines. 77% of the Israeli public is concerned about climate change; the difference between right-wing and left-wing voters is smaller than expected: 72% of right-wing voters and 89% of left-wing voters express concern about climate change. There is an understanding that the climate crisis is man-made. There is high trust in science and scientists (63%) compared to very low trust in social media (only 14%). There is a willingness to change behavioral habits for the sake of environmental protection (36% are willing to eat less meat, and 33% are willing to travel more by public transport). Key dilemmas on future land use for agriculture, forestry and nature in the EU, Berkhout et al., Wageningen University & Research The 2024 Mansholt Lecture focuses on the future use of land in agriculture, forestry, and nature. Current biomass demand for food, feed, and non-food is already high. Yet the use of biomass for food and feed is expected to stay at the current level, up until 2040. The need to transition away from the use of fossil fuels, however, will increase the use of biomass for chemicals and materials that are now produced from fossil feedstock. This led to the formulation of 5 important dilemmas for an EU dialogue, related to the future supply and demand for biomass and its implications for land use. Two of these dilemmas include climate and biodiversity targets: should a shared EU responsibility be tailored to each Member State and at what scale should food and non-food biomass production coexist with biodiversity and address climate targets? Escalating Emergencies: 20 Years of Pacific Climate Disasters, Oxfam Australia The number of people impacted by climate disasters in the Pacific increased by 700% on average in the last decade, compared to the previous decade. In a region numbering 14 million, climate disasters have affected 6.9 million Pacific Islanders in the last 20 years, not accounting for individuals and households who are affected by multiple disasters. Total costs from climate disasters have increased eightfold in the last decade. In the last two years, costs reached a high of $7.3 billion. The average GDP losses of Pacific countries are also increasing from decade to decade, with average yearly loss from climate disasters increasing four-fold\u2014from 3.2% between 2004 to 2013, to 14.3% of GDP in the last decade. In the case of Vanuatu, these losses reached 80% of the country's GDP, a devastating occurrence that happened twice for the island nation\u2014in 2015 and 2020",

For context, Australia\u2019s costliest disaster in recent memory (The QLD-NSW floods of 2022) resulted in damages that were 0.4% of GDP. Climate India 2024: An Assessment of Extreme Weather Events, Kiran Pandey and Rajit Sengupta, Centre for Science and Environment India faced extreme weather events on 93 percent of days in the first nine months of this year, marked by heat and cold waves, cyclones, lightning, heavy rain, floods, and landslides. These events claimed 3,238 lives, affected 3.2 million hectares of crops, destroyed 235,862 houses, and killed approximately 9,457 livestock. This reported damage is likely an underestimate due to incomplete data collection on event-specific losses, particularly public property, and crop damage The Educator's Guide to Climate Emotions, Carolyn McGrath and Kate Schapira, Climate Psychology Alliance of North America The climate crisis is profoundly impacting the emotional well-being of young people. While teaching about the causes, consequences, and responses to global warming, K-12 educators can create space for students to identify, understand, and express their feelings about living through a time of rapid environmental change. The authors offer suggestions for age-appropriate pedagogical approaches, cross-disciplinary teaching methods, as well as opportunities for collective action and collaboration. The guide highlights the transformative potential of incorporating emotions in climate education to foster a sense of agency, efficacy, and purpose among students. The Teacher-Friendly Guide to Climate Change, Zabel et al, Paleontological Research Institution The guide includes both the basics of climate change science and perspectives on teaching a subject that has become socially and politically polarized. The focus audience is high school Earth science and environmental science teachers, and it is written with an eye toward the kind of information and graphics that a secondary school teacher might need in the classroom. Ecological Threat Report 2024, The Institute for Economics & Peace Ecological threats, including climate change, food insecurity, and water scarcity, are increasingly recognized as significant factors that affect the dynamics of armed conflict. The authors survey current ecological risk levels. It takes an in-depth look at the impact of water scarcity and analyses the potential of improving water capture to mitigate multiple ecological threats in some of the world\u2019s worst-affected areas. Countries with higher levels of ecological threat are more likely to have higher levels of conflict and lower levels of societal safety and security. Without concerted international action, ecological degradation will continue to accelerate, intensifying a range of social issues, including malnutrition and forced migration. When combined with further stressors, such as demographic pressure and poor governance, the likely result will be an increase in conflict. Trump\u2019s proposed clean energy retreat: US costs and global rewards, Bentley Allan and Tim SaHay, Johns Hopkins University's Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab The Biden Administration\u2019s investments in climate leadership across the CHIPS Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have shifted the landscape of US and global clean energy supply chains. The IRA has created over $200 billion in clean energy investment inside the United States. CHIPS and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law created new government offices to support scientific and technological development. This kind of action is badly needed for the US to compete with China and regain a position in emerging clean energy supply chains. The US election results \u2014a likely trifecta with a Trump administration, a Republican-held Senate, and a Republican-held House\u2014point towards increased trade protectionism, removal of environmental regulations, and fossil fuel handouts. Yet the irony today is that a repeal of the climate portions of IRA, BIL, and CHIPS would harm the United States and create tens of billions of dollars in opportunities for other countries. These laws give the US a foothold in the clean technology race. State of the Cryosphere 2024 \u2013 Lost Ice, Global Damage, International Cryosphere Climate Initiative Current Nationally Determined Contributions are not sufficient to prevent significant overshoot of 1.5\u00b0C, with many governments delaying meaningful mitigation to 2040, 2050, or beyond. While perceived short-term as economically advantageous, for example lowering energy costs today, a slower transition from fossil fuels locks in widespread future loss and damage from the cryosphere for decades and centuries, with adaptation needs far higher and more expensive where still technically feasible. NGFS long-term scenarios for central banks and supervisors, Network for Greening the Financial System The authors explore the transition and physical effects of climate change, over a long time horizon and under varying assumptions using scenarios with an updated assessment of physical risk. The scenarios have been updated with new economic and climate data, policy commitments, and model versions. The scenarios now incorporate the latest GDP and population projections of the IPCC\u2019s Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). In addition, they include the most recent country-level climate commitments as of March 2024. The main results of the scenarios include limiting the temperature increase to 1.5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels in an orderly fashion is within reach but it requires substantially more intensive efforts than delineated in previous vintages; a substantial economic transformation affecting all sectors of the economy is required to achieve global net zero CO2 emissions by 2050; in all scenarios, the impact of physical risk rapidly outweighs the impact of transition efforts. The expected economic impact of unabated climate change has significantly increased. Due to the implementation of the new damage function, the projected physical risk impact has quadrupled by 2050 in some scenarios. These strong negative impacts on GDP could be mitigated by timely transition efforts. Extreme Weather, Extreme Content: How Big Tech Enables Climate Disinformation In a World on the Brink, Climate Action Against Disinformation The authors present three new case studies that provide a snapshot into the online world of English-language climate disinformation. The key findings from the report include opposition to renewables\u2014despite having years to clean up their platforms, Big Tech continues to allow a small number of \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d to pollute their platforms with debunked claims attacking renewable energy and electric vehicles; weaponizing wildfires-disinformation operations are exploiting extreme weather events to fuel opposition to climate policies, and recently, have led to threats of violence against emergency response personnel; and fossil fuel advertising on Meta-fossil fuel companies continue to use digital advertising to launder their image. Obtaining articles without journal subscriptions We know it's frustrating that many articles we cite here are not free to read. One-off paid access fees are generally astronomically priced, suitable for such as \"On a Heuristic Point of View Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light\" but not as a gamble on unknowns. With a median world income of US$ 9,373, for most of us US$ 42 is significant money to wager on an article's relevance and importance.

The fact of journal RSS output assigns a \"yes\" to this automatically. Is an article relevant to the topic of anthropogenic climate change? Due to filter overlap with other publication topics of inquiry, of a typical week's 550 or so input articles about 1/4 of RSS output makes the cut. A few journals offer public access to \"preprint\" versions of articles for which the review process is not yet complete. For some key journals this all the mention we'll see in RSS feeds, so we include such items in New Research. These are flagged as \"preprint.\" The section \"Informed opinion, nudges & major initiatives\" includes some items that are not scientific research per se but fall instead into the category of \"perspectives,\" observations of implications of research findings, areas needing attention, etc. Suggestions Please let us know if you're aware of an article you think may be of interest for Skeptical Science research news, or if we've missed something that may be important. Send your input to Skeptical Science via our contact form. Journals covered A list of journals we cover may be found here. We welcome pointers to omissions, new journals etc. Previous edition The previous edition of Skeptical Science New Research may be found here.",

In countries like India, China, Indonesia, and many more, gold is considered the ideal jewelry, in addition, gold is also served as a present/remembrance and even gold accessories are presented as marriage settlements. Moreover, the countries with large gold reserves are considered a booming nations. At present time, precious metal like gold, is not just considered ornaments or jewelry but are considered as an investment and are kept with all nations' central bank as an assurance for re-payment of non-native loans, and also to manage inflation. Due to the increasing demand and dispense of this asset in the market the state of the major economies throughout the globe has a considerable impact on gold prices. Due to the change in gold prices, more investors are now considering gold investments. But irregularity in the gold price in the market makes it riskier for the investor. Thus, the goal of \u201cGold price prediction\u201d is to forecast gold\u2019s price using a variety of Machine learning techniques, considering the relationship between several economic factors that influence gold rates. The machine learning algorithms that have been used are Random Forest regression, Decision tree (DT),\n\nTL;DR: The goal of \u201cGold price prediction\u201d is to forecast gold\u2019s price using a variety of Machine learning techniques, considering the relationship between several economic factors that influence gold rates.",

Predicting Bitcoin candlestick, i.e., open, high, low, and close (OHLC) prices, can help investors make trading decisions. This paper aims to explore various data normalization techniques in neural networks to enhance candlestick price prediction. In this study, the sliding window normalization techniques were compared with the whole set normalization techniques for forecasting the daily Bitcoin OHLC prices using two neural network algorithms: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The investigated normalization techniques for both the whole set and the sliding window set included z-score normalization, min-max normalization, and relative change normalization. Historical OHLC prices over several days were used to predict the next day's OHLC prices. The results show that the sliding window normalization techniques outperformed the whole set normalization techniques in terms of RMSE and MAPE with the best technique being the GRU algorithm using the sliding window relative change normalization achieving MAPE of 2.25% and RMSE of 870.52.\n\nTL;DR: This paper aims to explore various data normalization techniques in neural networks to enhance candlestick price prediction using two neural network algorithms: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).",

This study explores the application of deep learning methods, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks, in empowering robo-advisors to offer personalized investment recommendations and enhance decision-making processes for investors. Leveraging vast amounts of historical financial data, including market trends, asset prices, and economic indicators, LSTM and GRU networks are adept at capturing complex temporal patterns and dependencies within sequential data, enabling more accurate predictions of future stock prices and market trends. By employing these deep learning techniques, robo-advisors can analyze market dynamics in real-time, adapt investment strategies to changing conditions, and provide tailored recommendations aligned with individual investor preferences and risk profiles. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical studies, this paper evaluates the performance and effectiveness of LSTM and GRU networks in mutual fund and stock market price prediction tasks. The findings suggest that LSTM and GRU networks offer significant advantages over traditional forecasting methods, such as autoregressive models and technical analysis, by effectively capturing long-term dependencies and nonlinear relationships within financial time series data. Moreover, the integration of additional data sources, such as news sentiment analysis and social media trends, further enhances the predictive accuracy and robustness of the models. Overall, the application of deep learning techniques in empowering robo-advisors holds immense potential for revolutionizing investment management practices, democratizing access to financial markets, and empowering investors with actionable insights for informed decision-making. The proposed method is implemented in Python and has an accuracy of about 99.12%.\n\nTL;DR: The findings suggest that LSTM and GRU networks offer significant advantages over traditional forecasting methods, such as autoregressive models and technical analysis, by effectively capturing long-term dependencies and nonlinear relationships within financial time series data.",

Therefore, determining silver prices is critically important for both national economies and investors. However, the non-stationary and non-linear nature of silver prices makes predicting price movements challenging. The methods used for predicting silver prices must be suitable for capturing these volatile and complex behavioral characteristics. The silver market can be influenced by other commodities and investment assets. Factors affecting silver prices, such as gold prices, Brent crude oil prices, the US Dollar index, the VIX index, and the S&P 500 index, can play a significant role. In this context, these variables have been used as inputs for predicting silver prices in the study. Three different models have been developed to predict the prices one, two, and three days ahead. These models have been predicted using four different machine learning methods: linear regression, support vector regression (SMOReg), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and random forest (RF). The results show that the random forest and k-NN methods exhibit the highest performance. The random forest achieves the highest accuracy in the first two models, while k-NN excels in the third model. Linear regression and SMOReg methods are less successful compared to the others. Consequently, it can be concluded that random forest and k-NN methods can be preferred for long-term predictions, and that these results may provide valuable insights, especially for investors and decision-makers.\n\nTL;DR: It can be concluded that random forest and k-NN methods can be preferred for long-term predictions, and that these results may provide valuable insights, especially for investors and decision-makers.",

Within this domain, transformers, convolutional neural networks, and patch embedding-based techniques have emerged as popular choices within the computer vision community. Here, inspired by the latest cutting-edge computer vision methodologies and the existing work showing the capability of image-like conversion for time-series datasets, we apply more advanced transformer-based and patch-based approaches for predicting asset prices and directional price movements. The employed transformer models include Vision Transformer (ViT), Data Efficient Image Transformers (DeiT), and Swin. We use ConvMixer for a patch embedding-based convolutional neural network architecture without a transformer. Our tested transformer-based and patch-based methodologies aim to predict asset prices and directional movements using historical price data by leveraging the inherent image-like properties within the historical time-series dataset. Before the implementation of attention-based architectures, the historical time series price dataset is transformed into two-dimensional images. This transformation is facilitated through the incorporation of various common technical financial indicators, each contributing to the data for a fixed number of consecutive days. Consequently, a diverse set of two-dimensional images is constructed, reflecting various dimensions of the dataset. Subsequently, the original images depicting market valleys and peaks are annotated with labels such as Hold, Buy, or Sell. According to the experiments, trained attention-based models consistently outperform the baseline convolutional architectures, particularly when applied to a subset of frequently traded Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). This better performance of attention-based architectures, especially ViT, is evident in terms of both accuracy and other financial evaluation metrics, particularly during extended testing and holding periods. These findings underscore the potential of transformer-based approaches to enhance predictive capabilities in asset price and directional forecasting.

Before applying attention-based architecture, we have transformed historical time series price dataset into two-dimensional images by using various number of different technical indicators. Each indicator creates data for a fixed number of days. Thus, we construct two-dimensional images of various dimensions. Then, we use original images valleys and hills to label each image as Hold, Buy, or Sell.

Among the techniques, deep learning- based methods such as transformers, convolutional neural net- works, and patch embedding approaches have become quite popu- lar inside the computer vision researchers. In this research, inspired by the state-of-the-art computer vision methods, we have come up with 2 approaches: DAPP (Deep Attention-based Price Predic- tion) and DPPP (Deep Patch-based Price Prediction) that are based on vision transformers and patch embedding-based convolutional neural networks respectively to predict asset price and direction from historical price data by capturing the image properties of the historical time-series dataset. Before applying attention-based ar- chitecture, we have transformed historical time series price dataset into two-dimensional images by using various number of differ- ent technical indicators. Each indicator creates data for a fixed number of days. Thus, we construct two-dimensional images of various dimensions. Then, we use original images valleys and hills to label each image as Hold, Buy, or Sell. We find our trained attention-based models to frequently provide better results for ETFs in comparison to the baseline convolutional architectures in terms of both accuracy and financial analysis metrics during longer testing periods.

Asset Price and Direction Prediction via Deep 2D Transformer and Convolutional Neural Networks.

Nowadays, stocks are not the only instruments to be traded by traders and institutional investors. There are many more instruments such as options, Exchange- Traded Funds (ETFs), etc [1]. In line with such increase in the number of instruments, artificial intelligence-based trading sys- tems have become more important and functional in a number of different global markets [1]. Recently, deep learning methods have outperformed more tradi- tional machine learning-based models such as SVMs in a variety of classification or prediction tasks. Image processing tasks such as image segmentation or image classification appear to be one of the main domains where deep learning outperforms these more traditional methods [23]. A number of deep learning techniques have also started to appear for financial prediction and classification tasks such as asset price or direction prediction. Some examples are Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) [10], Convolutional Neu- ral Network (CNN) [3, 24], Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) [16], and Transformers [4]. However, application of these deep learning techniques on financial prediction tasks is not as common as their applications in computer vision. Among these techniques, CNNs have achieved one of the best performances [23] even though CNN architectures have mainly been used to solve computer vision tasks including image classification so far. On the other hand, Trans- formers [8, 30] have recently been introduced mainly for sequence analysis tasks in natural language processing, but since then they have outperformed CNNs in these vision tasks. For instance, Vi- sion Transformer (ViT) [8] achieves quite promising results and outperforms the best-performing convolutional neural networks, while its cost of training is also remarkably smaller than these state-of-the-art convolutional networks. Transformers apply the attention and self-attention mechanisms where attention is useful in drawing connections among any parts of the sequence or image. Relatedly, self-attention is an attention mechanism which relates 79 ICAIF \u201922, November 2\u20134, 2022, New York, NY, USA Tuna Tuncer, Uygar Kaya, Emre Sefer, Onur Alacam, and Tugcan Hoser different parts of an input while computing a representation of the same input. As a result, modeling longer range dependencies do not become a problem since the attention mechanisms introduction. Here, we come up with two approaches in our algorithmic trad- ing framework which predict both asset prices and directions: DAPP (Deep Attention-based Price Prediction) and DPPP (Deep Patch-based Price Prediction). One of them, DAPP, is a transformer- based algorithm that fully depends on using the attention and self- attention mechanisms. DAPP is based on Vision Transformer (ViT) which is a modified version of traditional transformers for computer vision tasks. Our second approach, DPPP, does not use the attention mechanism, but instead it is based on patch embedding-based con- volutional neural networks. Patch-embedding convolution neural networks can be considered between transformers and traditional convolutional neural networks, where they also use the patch em- beddings observed in transformers but they do not use the attention mechanism. As the first step, both approaches mainly transform one- dimensional financial time series dataset into a two-dimensional dataset similar to image. Via such dimension expanding transform, we can better incorporate successful vision transformers, CNNs, and patch-embedding qualities and capabilities into algorithmic trading. While transforming into such 2D representation, we use up to 65 technical indicators having various parameter combina- tions for certain time period to define every column\u2019s values. In this case, x axis is made up of historical time-series data for every indicator corresponding to every row. We order the rows of this 2D representation such that indicators exhibiting similar patterns are clustered so that y-axis changes are smooth and consecutive patterns can be captured by the deep learning techniques in DAPP and DPPP. In our models, DAPP and DPPP, we generate images of vari- ous dimensions via technical indicators and input them into vision transformer [8] and patch embedding-based convolution neural net- work respectively. The number of algorithmic trading approaches via transforming time series dataset into 2D representation is quite limited [24]. CNN-TA proposed in [24] uses convolutional neural networks to understand. However, as we will show in the results as well, convolutional neural networks are not superior to more- recently introduced architectures such as transformers or patch embedding-based CNNs. To our best knowledge, algorithmic trad- ing by transforming time series dataset into 2D representation and then processing such input via transformers or patch embedding- based CNNs similar to 2D image classification tasks has not been used before even for other financial prediction tasks. According to our detailed experiments, both of our approaches achieve the best performance across longer time periods compared to well-known baseline methods and similar method only using simpler CNNs without the transformer architecture. DAPP and DPPP have out- performed many trading algorithms over both longer and shorter testing periods including Buy & Hold strategy (BaH), technical indicator-based trading approaches, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, LSTM, and enhanced version of CNN-TA which is an another deep convolutional neural network-based prediction method over image-like data [24]. In general, transformer-based DAPP performs slightly better than DPPP across both accuracy and other financial analysis metrics which again shows the importance of attention-based mechanisms combined with patch embeddings in financial tasks such as stock price and direction prediction. Even though the performance of our proposed approaches are promis- ing, we can further enhance their performance via more detailed hyperparameter optimization and fine-tuning. The upcoming sections of the paper are organized as follows: Section 2 describes the related work after this introduction section. Our proposed solutions are discussed in section 3, which is followed by discussion on implementation and evaluation in section 4. We analyze the evaluation of the proposed approaches in section 5. Lastly, our conclusions are presented in section 6. 2 RELATED WORK Traditional machine learning methods have been used extensively to forecast stock markets.

Number of studies has focused on ap- plying time-series prediction approaches directly to the financial datasets. Another set of studies have applied fundamental or tech- nical analysis techniques to perform accurately in forecasting stock markets. [1] has published a survey on the whole set of forecasting methods including SVM, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), ensem- ble approaches, etc. [19, 32] have used ANNs to predict stock index values. [2] has come up with a neural network model to forecast in Taiwan stock index. [12] has compared MLP and dynamic ANN to forecast in US stock market. Additionally, [25] has come up with an ANN model which integrates a number of technical analysis indica- tors in predicting turning points of stock prices. In another work, [9] has focused on predicting foreign exchange (FX) via genetic algo- rithms by correcting the estimation errors. Lastly, a number of studies have focused on hybrid models to forecast stock prices. For instance, [31] proposes an approach to combine SVM with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Recently, newer deep learning approaches has started to appear as the computational capacity has increased. Deep learning is ba- sically a special case of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) which is made up of more than one layer where each layer contributes dif- ferently in way to outperform the shallower neural networks [18]. Various types of deep learning models exist such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term memory (LSTM), Re- current Neural Networks (RNN), and Transformers. These deep learning approaches are utilized across various domains. For in- stance, CNNs are highly utilized in classifying and recognizing the images [14, 17]. Additionally, CNNs also appear frequently in video processing as well as natural language processing tasks such as sentence categorization [13]. LSTMs and RNNs are mainly used to analyze sequential datasets appearing mostly in speech processing, natural language processing, and time-series related tasks. Lastly, more recently-introduced transformers are also used to analyze the sequential datasets. They have first been applied to NLP tasks [33], but recently they have also been successfully applied to computer vision tasks [8, 15]. Deep learning methods, especially deep CNNs and transformer- based architectures are the most commonly-used methods in the last decade. However, number of deep learning approaches developed for financial tasks is quite limited. For instance, [7] has come up with a deep learning-based approach to predict stock markets by using events data by extracting news and other textual knowledge from web. In their paper, they have focused on using a neural 80 Asset Price and Direction Prediction via Deep 2D Transformer and Convolutional Neural Networks ICAIF \u201922, November 2\u20134, 2022, New York, NY, USA tensor network and deeper CNN to take into account the shorter and longer horizon effects of events on stock price fluctuations across US stock market. Another paper [22] has compiled the set of existing deep learning methods to analyze financial time-series datasets such as stock market index prices via methods including convolution and pooling, RNN, autoencoder, etc. [10] has forecasted the stock trends and directions in S&P 500. Similarly, [16] has evaluated random forests and deep neural networks in forecasting the stock prices across S&P 500. Moreover, [34] has developed an approach to forecast the stock price trends by integrating news on Japanese exchange, which has outperformed more traditional machine learning-based method SVM. Lastly, [26] and [24] are more relevant work to ours. In [26], they integrate technical analysis indicators into their prediction. They have developed evolutionary methods to select the optimal technical analysis parameters for indicators, and afterwards used a feedforward neural network (FNN) that uses those optimal parameters as the input. Similarly, [24] come up with an approach called CNN-TA, which combines CNNs with two-dimensional matrix characterization of the technical analysis datasets. According to the both relevant papers, deep learning can learn and generalize quite accurately across buy and sell time points over longer testing horizons. Similarly, number of transformer-based approaches for predic- tion tasks across financial markets is extremely limited. For in- stance, [36] proposes a novel transformer architecture that is based on accurate description via smaller sample feature engineering to capture financial datasets temporal relationships. In another work, [6] proposes a novel transformer-based method to predict stock movements. Their approach integrates a multi-scale Gauss- ian prior to further improve the transformer\u2019s locality. Lastly, [20] comes up with a capsule network that is based on transformer in extracting deeper semantic attributes of the social media dataset\u2019s rich semantics. The existing studies use CNNs quite frequently for image anal- ysis and classification tasks, while CNNS are not mainly used for time-series datasets. CNNs are quite successful on computer vision tasks and the performance increase achieved by CNNs are signifi- cant. Deep learning methods, more frequently LSTM and RNN, have recently been the common implementation options for financial time-series prediction. On the other hand, the existing algorithmic trading approaches frequently use technical analysis indicators together with different input. Nevertheless, there are not many methods which combined such technical analysis datasets with deep learning techniques. Furthermore, there are only few studies in algorithmic trading that combine CNNs with two-dimensional matrix characterization of the technical analysis datasets [5, 23\u201325]. In these studies, deeper CNN models are integrated with the tech- nical analysis datasets. These methods typically convert financial time-series prediction problem into an image classification task by generating two-dimensional images of indicators from the prices. 3 OUR PROPOSED METHODS: DAPP AND DPPP Following subsections 3.1-3.3 are common for both methods. Sec- tions 3.4-3.5 provide specific details for DAPP and DPPP respec- tively. 3.1 Dataset Preparation To analyze financial data, fundamental analysis and technical anal- ysis (TA) are two frequently-used techniques [1]. Fundamental analysis examines financial data specific to a company such as re- turn on equity, cash flow, and balance sheet. On the other hand, technical analysis examines the historical time-series dataset via mathematical models. Number of available technical indicators to predict the financial asset prices are quite high. In our case, Open-High-Low-Close-Volume (OHLCV) data for 9 of the selected Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) were collected from finance.yahoo.com via the yfinance library for training and testing intention. These ETFs are XLF, XLU, QQQ, SPY, XLP, EWZ, EWH, XLY, XLE. We chose those ETFSs since they have data trading data for large number of days with a high volume. For each of these ETF, 65 different technical indicators [21] with different time horizons based on various categories including overlap studies, momentum, volume, volatility, price transformation, and statistics, were calcu- lated by using OHLCV data and TA-Lib (Technical Analysis Library) in Python. Table 1 shows all technical indicators used in our analy- sis (See https://mrjbq7.github.io/ta-lib/ for more details for these indicators). We have used ETF prices over 20 year period, from 1/1/2002 to 1/1/2022 for training and testing our approaches. This 20 year period covers two major crises: 2008 economic crisis and 2020 COVID crisis",

The portion below the threshold points are labeled as Buy, the portion above the threshold 81 ICAIF \u201922, November 2\u20134, 2022, New York, NY, USA Tuna Tuncer, Uygar Kaya, Emre Sefer, Onur Alacam, and Tugcan Hoser points are labeled as Sell, and the remaining points are labeled as Hold. The selection of the threshold value is very crucial since the frequency of the generated datasets (such as high-frequency) de- pend on the threshold value. In our case, by choosing two specific threshold values 0.0038 and 0.01, we generate both a balanced and an imbalanced datasets to be analyzed. We test the financial quality and the robustness of our proposed solutions by evaluating them over both balanced and imbalanced datasets. With a threshold of 0.0038, the data is distributed as evenly as possible so that forecasts are made over the balanced dataset. On the other hand, at a thresh- old of 0.01, it is a good idea to buy ahead if the asset price increases by 1% in a day, and sell if it drops by 1%. In this case, generating the datasets by using a threshold of 0.0038 establishes the framework for a higher-frequency trading approach. But, threshold of 0.01 makes forecasts that are more hold-centric and are comparable to a buy-and-hold strategy. 3.3 Technical Indicators to Images We transformed our time-series datasets into 2D images to utilize in our methods and some of the baseline approaches. In the image creation phase, as discussed above, for each day, RSI, WMA, EMA, SMA, ROC, CMO, CCI, PPO, TEMA, WILLR, MACD, and 54 more technical indicator values for different horizons are calculated using the TA-Lib library (These indicator horizons range from 6 to 20 days). These indicators can also be seen as financial time-series filters which are used mostly for medium term algorithmic trading which is our main focus in this research. Different set of indicators with longer horizon parameters can be used for models aiming for longer term algorithmic trading. Since we have generated our images using these 65 different technical indicators for 65 historical days, the size of the images we obtained is 65 \u00d7 65. In addition, each row in the images we have generated shows 65 different technical indicators, while each column represents a different previous day. The order of the indica- tors is important since different orderings will result in different image formations. The resulting indicator values were sorted by their categories and correlation values, and images were generated using that ordering. In addition, after the images were generated, the standardization process was applied to each image in order to make each of these images more consistent. As an example, Figure 1 illustrates sample 65 \u00d7 65 pixel images that are generated during the image generation and labeling phases. Figure 1: 65 \u00d7 65 Pixel Labeled Sample Images 3.4 Deep Attention-based Price Prediction: DAPP Once data collection, labeling, and image conversion steps are ac- complished, DAPP applies Vision Transformer (ViT) [8] by training with the generated images and constructed labels. During the adap- tation and development of transformers with self-attention-based architectures for computer vision tasks over images, one of the main challenges is that the run time of the model becomes qua- dratic with respect to the number of pixels, as each pixel will attend to one another. Vision Transformer solved this problem by dividing the image into patches and applying self-attention to each patch separately. Meanwhile, Vision Transformer flattens each patch and applies positional embedding on top, before feeding the patches into the transformer encoder structure, thus aiming to preserve the positional information in the images. The Transformer encoder [30] is made up of multi-head self-attention and MLP blocks. Layer nor- malization is applied before every block, and residual connections are applied after every block. Finally, a single hidden layer MLP is connected to the end of the transformer encoder for classification. More formally, let \ud835\udc36be the number of channels and (\ud835\udc3b,\ud835\udc4a) be the resolution of the original image, DAPP reshapes the generated image \ud835\udc65\u2208R\ud835\udc3b\u00d7\ud835\udc4a\u00d7\ud835\udc36into a series of flattened two-dimensional patches \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d\u2208R\ud835\udc41\u00d7\ud835\udc432\u00b7\ud835\udc36where (\ud835\udc43, \ud835\udc43) is the resolution of each image patch, and \ud835\udc41= \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc4a \ud835\udc432 is the resulting number of patches, which also serves as the effective input sequence length for the transformer. The transformer utilizes constant hidden vector size \ud835\udc37through all of its layers, so we flatten the patches and map to \ud835\udc37dimensions with a trainable linear projection. The output of this projection is referred as patch embeddings. As indicated in [8], especially with large scale datasets and pre-training, the vision transformer approaches frequently sur- pass state-of-the-art performing CNNs. However, they also point out that when trained on medium-sized datasets without a strong regularization, Vision Transformer falls a few percentages below state-of-the-art CNN architectures like ResNet. This is thought to be because Vision Transformer lacks the inductive bias that is common in CNNs. Since our vision transformer-based architecture DAPP is trained on medium-sized datasets (approximately 45000 images), we have also employed Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) technique [11] to enhance the quality of our results and make them more robust. Number of heads in Vision Transformer part of DAPP is 4, patch size is 8, projection dimension is 64, and there are 8 transformer layers in DAPP. Unless stated otherwise, batch size for DAPP train- ing is 128, training is run for 100 epochs, and AdaDelta [35] is used as the optimizer which is a stochastic optimizer allowing for per-dimension learning rate for stochastic gradient descent. 3.5 Deep Patch-based Price Prediction: DPPP Once data collection, labeling, and image conversion steps are ac- complished, DPPP applies patch embedding-based ConvMixer [29] by training with the generated images and constructed labels.

As a result, ConvMixer 82 Asset Price and Direction Prediction via Deep 2D Transformer and Convolutional Neural Networks ICAIF \u201922, November 2\u20134, 2022, New York, NY, USA basically replaces the encoder architecture in Vision Transformer with convolutional neural networks. ConvMixer divides the im- ages into patches, flattens them, applies positional embedding, as in Vision Transformer, and then employs standard convolutions instead of inserting patch embeddings into the transformer encoder. Additionally, the concept of mixing introduced in [28] is another significant component utilized in ConvMixer. Concept of mixing is applied to incorporate the self-attention mechanism\u2019s characteristic of mixing distant spatial locations in the ConvMixer architecture by employing significantly larger kernel sizes than usual. In other words, ConvMixer aims to replicate the effects of self-attention even if it does not implement self-attention. In DPPP, ConvMixer architecture utilizes \"tensor layout\" patch embeddings with patch size 2 for locality preservation, and then keeps applying \ud835\udc51= 8 copies of a simple fully-convolutional block which mainly consists of large-kernel with size 7 depthwise convo- lution, Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) activation, and batch nor- malization. This repeated fully-convolutional blocks are followed by pointwise convolution, before finishing with global pooling and a simple linear classifier. Unless stated otherwise, batch size for DPPP training is 32, training is run for 200 epochs, and AdaDelta [35] is used as the optimizer. 4 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 4.1 Data Preparation As we have performed a financial evaluation on the trained models, we have chosen the test dataset in a continuous interval. We have used ETF prices over 20 year period between 1/1/2002 to 1/1/2022 for training and testing our approaches. We have implemented a sliding window with retraining technique where we choose a consecutive 5 year interval as the training period and choose the following one year as the testing period. Afterwards, train and test periods are shifted one year forward, trained our models again, and tested with the next year. Therefore, we test each year between 2007 and 2021 once via our repeated retraining approach. The resulting indicator values were sorted by their categories and correlation values, and images were generated using that ordering. In addition, after the images were generated, the standardization process was applied to each image in order to make each of our images more consistent. Given that the images are generated at daily intervals, a total of 45090 images, or 5010 images for each ETF, were generated. All generated images were gathered under a single dataset to train a single model because we didn\u2019t have a large enough dataset to build a separate model for each ETF. 4.2 Baseline Approaches: Buy & Hold and Enhanced CNN-TA One of our basic baseline is Buy & Hold Strategy (BaH) which buys the asset when the test period starts and sells it once the test period is over. We have also employed CNN-TA [24] as our next baseline after enhancing it further. CNN-TA is a deep convolutional neural network-based prediction method over image-like data [24]. It consists of an input layer, two convolutional layers with 3 \u00d7 3 filters, a max pooling layer, two dropout layers with rates 0, 25 and 0.5, a fully connected layer, and finally an output layer. CNN-TA is a fully convolutional structure without any patch embeddings and attention mechanisms. The adapted CNN structure of CNN-TA is similar to deep convolutional neural networks utilized in MNIST algorithm, where 28 \u00d7 28 images have been used in MNIST as input. In our case, we do not directly apply CNN-TA, but instead increase the number of used indicators further enhancing its performance. So, that is why we name the method as Enhanced CNN-TA. We have re-implemented CNN-TA by enhancing it in the following way: We have used 65 \u00d7 65 images instead of 15 \u00d7 15 image as input, increasing the number of technical indicators used as well as the used data history. 4.3 Performance Evaluation We evaluate the performance of our methods DAPP and DPPP, baselines enhanced CNN-TA and Buy & Hold strategy by both traditional prediction metrics as well as financial metrics. In terms of computational prediction, we report the performance by using Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1 score which assess how well the methods perform the Buy, Hold, and Sell classification. On the other hand, for financial evaluation, daily trading transactions have been simulated according to the models predictions, using the test dataset. The model\u2019s annualized return as well as the annualized risk of the returns during the test period are used to calculate Sharpe Ratio [27], which is one of the most common metric to financially evaluate the performance of a strategy. Sharpe ratio is calculated as the ratio of annualized portfolio return relative to risk free return divided by annualized standard deviation, where we use 3-month US treasury bill return for risk free rate. Once algorithmic trading is executed for the test periods, we ana- lyze the generated transactions via financial evaluation techniques. We buy, sell, and hold each asset depending on the predicted label. If the predicted label for an asset is Buy and we have not bought the asset previously, we buy the asset with all of the existing capital. We do not take any action if the predicted label is Hold. Lastly, if the predicted label is Sell, we sell the asset at that price if it has been already bought. We ignore the consecutively repeating labels until predicted label becomes different. We assume a trading commission of $1 for each transaction since the traded ETFs are quite liquid, and have $10000 capital at the beginning. Our code and processed datasets are available at https://github.com/seferlab/SPDPvCNN. 5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We use two different evaluation criterion to evaluate the general performance of our models DAPP and DPPP with respect to the baselines: Machine Learning (ML)-based Evaluation and Financial Evaluation. With the ML-based evaluation, metrics such as Accu- racy, Recall, Precision, and F1 score were utilized to assess how well the neural network performs the Buy, Hold, and Sell classifi- cation, while for Financial Evaluation, daily trading transactions were simulated according to the model\u2019s predictions, using the test dataset with a different time intervals which include the recent COVID-19 pandemic period as well. The return produced by the model\u2019s choices, as well as the risk involved, are assessed as a result of the simulation. 83 ICAIF \u201922, November 2\u20134, 2022, New York, NY, USA Tuna Tuncer, Uygar Kaya, Emre Sefer, Onur Alacam, and Tugcan Hoser 5.1 Machine Learning-based Evaluation We analyze the prediction abilities of our models DAPP and DPPP in terms of multiple metrics as seen in Tables 2-3 respectively. Basically, these tables report the classification performances over imbalanced dataset formed by using threshold 0.01. Results are reported in terms of recall, precision, F1 for each price direction category. We also report the overall precision, F1 and accuracy. According to tables, DPPP and DAPP perform almost similarly, and obtain an overall near 0.62 \u22120.63 accuracy. When we analyze the performance of both methods in detail for predicting each class Buy, Sell, and Hold, both methods also perform similarly. In our case, our financial image dataset is still relatively smaller compared to the datasets in other deep learning applications. So, due to such relatively smaller dataset, we believe attention-based transformer architecture DAPP does not fully reach its best performance. We believe the difference between DAPP and DPPP will become more apparent when we train our methods with more data. Additionally, DPPP\u2019s performance being almost as good as DAPP across many metrics shows that efficient and careful design of an architecture using patch embedding together with convolutional structures may unexpectedly perform as good as transformer structure",

Additionally, DPPP\u2019s performance being almost as good as DAPP across many metrics shows that efficient and careful design of an architecture using patch embedding together with convolutional structures may unexpectedly perform as good as transformer structure. Moreover, due to the imbalanced dataset, it becomes very difficult for the models to distinguish between Buy and Sell labeled images from Hold labeled images. As a result, in most cases across imbalanced dataset, this results in our models predicting Hold for most images. Table 2: Classification performance of DAPP over imbalanced dataset formed by using threshold 0.01. Results are reported in terms of recall, precision, F1 for each price direction cate- gory. We also report the overall precision, F1 and accuracy.

While DAPP and DPPP have better test accuracy in the imbalanced dataset, both methods give worse results for the Buy and Sell labels than in the balanced dataset. We think that this issue arises because the number of Buy and Sell labels in the imbalanced training dataset are lower than in the balanced dataset. In general, when compared to the performance of other studies focusing on stocks rather than ETFs, overall accuracy of our ETF results are better. Such results can be mainly because ETFs are less sensitive to market events, political changes, and economic crisis compared to stocks. As a result, ETFs are more stable and less volatile. This lower volatility results in a better environment for algorithmic trading methods to learn the trading model more easily.

We mainly analyze annualized returns for each ETF, as well as Sharpe ratio [27] for equal-weighted portfolio of all these ETFs over different methods. As discussed in Section 4.3, we have simulated financial analysis for each ETF by simulating the transactions over the test set period. Even though Buy & Hold (BaH) strategy looks like a simpler strategy, it is still a challenging task to beat Buy & Hold strategy in a longer test period. In our case, DAPP\u2019s and DPPP\u2019s annualized returns have outperformed BaH strategy in 8 out of 9 ETFs dur- ing the test period in imbalanced dataset as seen in Table 4 where the highest annualized returns are shown in bold. For instance, DAPP\u2019s annualized return is 18.04% for XLF whereas BaH\u2019s annu- alized return for the same ETF is 8.71%, where the difference is more than 2 folds. For some ETFs such as EWH, BaH can result in negative annualized returns whereas adapting a better architec- ture results in positive returns, and makes the performance even more robust. When BaH strategy has beaten our methods in QQQ, the performance difference between DAPP and BaH is less than 1%. In general, DAPP is the top performer across almost all ETFs. Even though we have used the enhanced version of CNN-TA as our baseline, integrating the transformer architecture as well as patch embeddings have remarkably outperformed Enhanced CNN-TA as seen in Table 4. Enhanced CNN-TA results show the importance of convolutional architectures, but also show that their results can be further enhanced by adapting more recent better-performing techniques. In terms of Sharpe Ratio of the equal-weighted port- folio among these ETFs, our attention-based approach DAPP still performs better than DPPP and the other competing approaches. In this imbalanced dataset, DAPP achieves a Sharpe Ratio of 2.74 which is reasonably high for a strategy that trades equity indices. Similarly, the annualized returns of DAPP and DPPP have outper- formed BaH strategy in 8 out of 9 ETFs during the test period in the balanced dataset as seen in Table 5 where the highest annualized returns are shown in bold. In general, DAPP is the top performing method over almost all ETFs. Integrating transformer architecture as well as patch embeddings into asset price prediction have again remarkably outperformed Enhanced CNN-TA as seen in Table 5 for most ETFs.

For instance, in this balanced dataset, DAPP achieves a Sharpe ratio of 1.82 which is lower than 2.74 ratio obtained over the imbalanced dataset. According to our machine learning-based and financial evaluations so far, both DAPP and DPPP seem like safer strategies than only convolutional architectures in terms of investing into ETFs.

According to our machine learning-based and financial evaluations so far, both DAPP and DPPP seem like safer strategies than only convolutional architectures in terms of investing into ETFs. Table 5: Financial performance comparison of our methods DAPP and DPPP with respect to Enhanced CNN-TA approach and baseline Boy & Hold strategy for each ETF in balanced dataset that is generated at threshold 0.0038.

As discussed in Section, we start our analysis with $10000 capital and simulate transaction- based financial analysis. In each figure, DAPP and DPPP perfor- mances are compared against the other methods during the selected period. Capital allocation results for remaining ETFs are also simi- lar. For most of the test period intervals, trades generated via our proposed methods are quite successful. We have observed different market conditions during our lengthy test period which includes stationary market condition, bull markets, bear markets, etc. How- ever, these different market conditions and fluctuations associated with them have not impacted the trading performance of the pro- posed methods. As a result, both DAPP and DPPP could lead to high profits even under bear market conditions. Figure 2: Comparison of our proposed methods DAPP and DPPP with respect to Enhanced CNN-TA and Buy & Hold strategies for XLP and XLE ETFs respectively over the imbal- anced dataset. 6 CONCLUSION In our study, we have developed two methods that uses two-dimensional deep attention-based neural networks and two-dimensional deep patch embedding based convolutional neural networks in predicting financial asset prices. Our approaches utilize a number of technical analysis indicators, and develop algorithmic trading strategies as the end product. By analyzing financial time-series ETF datasets, we have first transformed such data into 2D images as input to our methods DAPP and DPPP. To generate profitable trades, we have fo- cused on forecasting entry and exit points of the time-series values in terms of three categories: Buy, Sell, and Hold. According to our machine learning-based and financial results, our methods perform quite better than Buy & Hold baseline and enhanced version of the only convolutional CNN-TA method over longer out-of-sample test periods. Both the attention mechanism and patch embeddings are useful in increasing the asset price and direction prediction performance. 85 ICAIF \u201922, November 2\u20134, 2022, New York, NY, USA Tuna Tuncer, Uygar Kaya, Emre Sefer, Onur Alacam, and Tugcan Hoser Even though our methods performance is reasonable, we can still achieve more improvements. In terms of future work, we will first integrate more stocks and ETFs to generate significantly larger amount of data for training our proposed deep learning models. Ad- ditionally, we will focus on better analyzing the relationships among technical indicators so that we will generate better 2D representa- tions for prediction tasks. As a result, such better representation will possibly lead to trading models with higher profitability. We will also focus more on optimizing DAPP and DPPP parameters which was not our main focus in this paper. Lastly, we have eval- uated the performance by using a long-only strategy. Instead, we may adapt a long-short strategy to remarkably increase the profit as such long-short strategy will decrease the number of times our method will be holding a cash while waiting for a buy or sell signal.

A centralized marketplace is provided by a stock exchange where stocks can be traded by buyers and sellers coming together, thereby ensuring liquidity and price transparency. Large studies have been conducted for a long time in regions such as foreign exchange, stock prices, and weather reviews where time series forecasting information has been comprised. In our research work, we will use time series data because time series allows us to compare what elements have an effect on certain variables from time to time. The primary goal of this review paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the research conducted by various scholars on predicting stock market prices using time series data. Evaluating time series data can provide valuable insights into the changes in a particular asset, security, or financial variable over time. Forecasting techniques using time series analysis are employed in both fundamental and technical analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: The primary goal of this review paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the research conducted by various scholars on predicting stock market prices using time series data.",

Introduction The stock marketplace is a market in which securities including shares and bonds are offered and sold. Exchanges often function as ongoing auction markets, with buyers and sellers completing trades through public protests at central venues such as stock exchanges or through electronic trading platforms. It is a market that connects savers and borrowers, and as a financial market, it transfers capital and money from those who have excess cash to those who need funds and investments. Investors are generally referred to as profit-making entities and business and deficit units and connect borrowers and lenders. Large studies have been conducted for a long time in regions such as foreign exchange, stock prices, and weather reviews where time series forecasting information has been comprised. In the starting, issues with economic evaluation and prediction had been solved through statistical models and methods. Over the past few years, a plethora of learning models based on artificial neural networks have emerged to tackle financial data issues and deliver accurate results for predicting future trends and prices. Modern-day time series prediction consists of the prediction of exchange rates. This section covers the topic of a stock exchange, highlighting both its advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, the potential impact of stock exchange prediction on the economic growth of various countries is examined. Furthermore, it emphasizes the impact of the financial market, big data analysis, and time series data. The stock market investment provides a safe and regulated environment in which investors can confidently share their trades, which helps them increase versatility, higher return in a shorter period, and higher liquidity. On the other hand, the stock market has some cons which may lead to low margins, high brokerage, impulsive investment, time consumption, and lack of knowledge may lead to a higher risk of losses. Financial markets have a tremendous influence on a country's economy since they are the engine that drives it. A greater focus has been placed on stock trading recently. One popular approach to attempt stock market forecasting is to model conventional financial data sources using deep Pakistan Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences, 11(2), 2023 1111 learning and machine learning methods. Deep learning and machine learning models are often trained on technical indications, macroeconomic factors, and fundamental indicators to forecast future stock performance. However, with the increasing interest in big data, deep learning, and machine techniques, the popularity of monitoring the stock market using new analytical techniques is growing. Modern stock trading involves the complex use of technology. As traders demand information to maximize their profits, the race to obtain relevant information is very interesting. Therefore, it is desirable to support financial analysts by making financial data available using modern modeling techniques such as financial language models. Tools and modeling techniques are being sought by investors to increase their profits and reduce risks, but the stock market is known to be a difficult domain to predict. The rational goal of an organization is to provide value. With hundreds of millions of events occurring every day and stored in large volumes, the focus on deriving value from data is growing. Tools that interact with big data are of great interest to many organizations because modern modeling technology makes it possible to predict behavior and events. Because of this, data is considered one of the most valuable commodities in automated decision-making systems. These technologies are used by several businesses across numerous sectors. Financial professionals employ a variety of data to conduct market monitoring and predictive research since big data has grown to be a significant component of the financial sector. In addition, the financial industry uses data and technology to enable efficient and accurate information processing. As a result, financial applications such as risk analysis, real- time analytics, fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and consumer analytics were born. However, a larger number of potential use cases are still largely uncharted due to the growing amount of unstructured data such as text data. On the other hand, financial institutions and industries are discovering the value of text data for applications such as chatbots for customer engagement and text analytics for market insights. Extracting and structuring unstructured economic text is an undertaking task, yet an essential step in understanding statistics profits. Time series analysis can offer valuable insights into the behavior of a particular asset, security, or financial variable over time. Additionally, it can be utilized to investigate the relationship between changes in a specific data factor and fluctuations in other variables over the same period. A set of observations obtained by making repeated measurements over time is known as a time series statistic. When factors are plotted on a graph, time is always represented on one of the axes. Subsets of data tracked over the years are referred to as time series metrics. For instance, a metric should check the number of shares that were bought in a trade from a certain point to the next. Time series information is anywhere due to the fact time is part of the entire that is observable. With our global surroundings becoming more instrumented, sensors and systems constantly transmit a steady flow of time series data. Time series data can also comprise server metrics, overall software program performance monitoring, activity, sensor records, network data, clicks, and various other types of analytical data. The stock market promotes investment and ensures price transparency and liquidity. The elevating of capital permits businesses to develop their organizations. The stock market exists to serve the wider economy. Somehow the stock market provides a ready market for buying and selling depending. The stock market promotes investment and ensures price transparency and liquidity. Predicting stock market trends and prices plays a crucial role in determining the future value of a company's shares and other financial transactions in the market. Accurate predictions of stock prices can have a positive impact on the economy of a country. It helps investors know which factor influences the price of stock more. Stock market prediction helps generate an increase in the sales rate, GDP, and earnings of the corporation. In the next section, we will discuss the literature review related to stock exchange price prediction which is further divided into subsections. However, section three discusses the review based outcomes and section four concluded the research. 2.

After reviewing the literature related to the prediction of stock exchange price, there is still plenty of areas that requires attention. It is suggested that advanced approaches of deep learning or hybrid models that use both stock price indexes and sentiment news analysis should be implemented to improve the knowledge in stock market price prediction research. Multinational datasets and datasets of less than a day should be used for the analysis of the price. For ease of future researchers, more datasets should be available publicly. 4. Conclusion A country's economic status has become fundamentally linked to the stock market. The stock market has become a challenging task nowadays by the price of forecasting. Many researchers conducted a study on stock market price prediction but none of them gave the novelty of a price prediction interval of less than one day. In our proposed work, we use the future work of the previously studied paper, which is our novelty: This study aims to predict stock market prices within a day and extend the research to include European and Asian stock markets. The results produced from this project will benefit the business in terms of capturing useful insights into various factors influencing stock exchange strategies. References Karthik, C. a.

      "content": "# Market State Detection and Regime Switching: A Comprehensive Overview\n\nMarket state detection and regime switching are crucial concepts in financial modeling, aiming to identify and predict shifts in market dynamics.  These shifts, often characterized by changes in volatility, trends, and correlations, significantly impact investment strategies, risk management, and trading decisions. This article delves into the fundamental principles of market state detection, focusing on regime-switching models, particularly Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and explores their applications, controversies, and future research directions.\n\n## I. Fundamental Concepts\n\nMarket regimes are periods of persistent and similar market conditions [S94]. Identifying these regimes helps investors understand the underlying market dynamics and adapt their strategies accordingly.  Regime changes can be abrupt [S86], representing significant structural shifts, or more gradual, reflecting cyclical patterns.  These shifts influence various market characteristics, including volatility [S87, S88, S94], trends [S107], and correlations between different assets [S94, S107].\n\nSeveral approaches exist for detecting market regimes [S94]:\n\n* **Statistical Approaches:**  These methods use historical market data to identify patterns and shifts.  Examples include Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) [S87, S88, S96, S97, S107, S108, S113, S128], Vector Autoregression (VAR) models [S113, S115], and Markov-switching regression models (MSR) [S107, S108, S113].  HMMs, in particular, are powerful tools for discovering latent states or regimes that are not directly observable from the data [S88]. [[Fundamental Principles of Hidden Markov Models]]\n* **Machine Learning Approaches:**  These techniques leverage the power of algorithms to learn from data and identify complex patterns.  Examples include clustering algorithms like k-means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) [S94], and more sophisticated methods that integrate machine learning with HMMs [S107, S108]. [[Machine Learning Integration with HMMs]]\n\n\n## II. Regime-Switching Models: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)\n\nHMMs are a class of stochastic state-space models particularly well-suited for detecting market regimes [S88, S96].  They assume the existence of \"hidden\" or \"latent\" states (market regimes) that influence observable variables (e.g., asset returns) [S88]. The model aims to infer the current hidden state from the observed data.\n\n**Key Components of an HMM:**\n\n* **Hidden States:**  These represent the unobservable market regimes (e.g., high volatility, low volatility, bull market, bear market) [S88, S94].\n* **Observations:**  These are the observable market data (e.g., asset returns, trading volume) which are influenced by the hidden states [S88].\n* **Transition Probabilities:** These define the probability of moving from one hidden state to another [S86, S96, S115, S129, S137].  A Markov property is usually assumed, meaning the future state depends only on the current state [S96]. [[Markov Transition Probability Estimation]]\n* **Emission Probabilities:** These define the probability of observing particular data given a specific hidden state [S129].  Often, these are modeled using probability distributions (e.g., Gaussian distributions for asset returns) [S89].\n\n**Fitting an HMM:**  The parameters of an HMM (transition and emission probabilities) are estimated from historical data using algorithms such as the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm or Gibbs sampling [S121, S124].  The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as likelihood scores [S89] and the accuracy of regime predictions. [[Bayesian Inference in Market Modeling]]\n\n\n## III. Practical Applications and Implications\n\nRegime-switching models, particularly HMMs, have various applications in finance:\n\n* **Asset Price Prediction:**  While not perfect, HMMs can improve the accuracy of asset price predictions by incorporating regime-dependent dynamics [S86]. [[Asset Price Prediction Techniques]]\n* **Portfolio Volatility Estimation:** HMMs can estimate portfolio volatility more accurately by considering regime-dependent changes in correlations between assets [S96]. [[Portfolio Volatility Estimation]]\n* **Risk Management:**  Regime-switching models allow for more sophisticated risk management by identifying periods of high volatility and adjusting portfolio allocations accordingly [S88, S96, S129]. [[Risk Management Modeling]]\n* **Algorithmic Trading:**  HMMs can be integrated into algorithmic trading strategies to dynamically adapt trading signals based on the detected market regime [S88]. [[Algorithmic Trading Strategies]]\n* **High-Frequency Trading:** The speed and computational efficiency of HMMs make them potentially valuable for high-frequency trading applications, although the assumption of a Markov process may be questioned in this context [S87]. [[High-Frequency Trading Applications]]\n\n\n## IV. Controversies and Ongoing Debates\n\nDespite the attractive premise of regime-switching models, several controversies and debates exist:\n\n* **Model Reliability:** The accuracy of regime-switching models heavily depends on the quality and quantity of historical data, the chosen model structure, and the underlying assumptions [S86, S121]. Overfitting is a potential concern, particularly with more complex models [S108]. [[Limitations and Assumptions of HMM in Finance]]\n* **Stationarity Assumption:** HMMs often assume stationary transition probabilities [S91], which may not hold in real-world markets experiencing structural changes. This limits the model's ability to adapt to long-term shifts in market dynamics [S108].\n* **Computational Challenges:**  Fitting and applying HMMs to high-dimensional data can be computationally intensive [S87, S129].  [[Computational Challenges in Financial HMMs]]\n* **Interpretation of Hidden States:** The interpretation of hidden states can be subjective and context-dependent. Different models may identify different regimes, even when applied to the same data [S94]. [[Financial Market State Inference]]\n\n## V. Future Directions and Open Questions\n\nSeveral avenues for future research exist:\n\n* **Developing more sophisticated HMM models:**  Incorporating non-linear dynamics, time-varying transition probabilities, and external factors into HMMs to improve their accuracy and adaptability [S121, S129].\n* **Integrating different modeling approaches:**  Combining statistical and machine learning approaches to improve the robustness and accuracy of regime detection [S94, S107].\n* **Developing improved model evaluation metrics:**  Metrics that capture not only prediction accuracy but also the economic value of regime detection, considering trading costs and transaction frequency [S88].\n* **Incorporating expert knowledge and qualitative information:**  Combining quantitative data with expert insights to improve model interpretability and decision-making [S91].\n* **Real-time applications:**  Developing real-time algorithms capable of handling the speed and complexity of high-frequency data.  [S87].\n\nFurthermore, further research is needed to understand how to best handle the controversies and debates noted above.  Addressing these challenges will greatly enhance the effectiveness of regime-switching models in finance.\n\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of market state detection and regime switching, focusing on the application of HMMs in financial modeling.  While the techniques offer significant potential for enhancing investment strategies and risk management, ongoing research and improvements are crucial to overcome limitations and controversies inherent in these sophisticated approaches.\n",

To: DesertRhino \u201cCheating...\u201d Fair enough. But the same could probably have been said with the introduction of any new technology to the field. The first sculptor to use electric power tools probably heard \u201ccheater\u201d from the guys just using hammers and chisels. If a robot can chisel out a near-perfect replica of the Venus de Milo or Michelangelo\u2019s David or Augustus of Prima Porta, I\u2019d imagine that there\u2019ll be a market for that sort of thing.

To: DesertRhino Of course, there can be human creativity in designing what the robotic arm chisels out. That\u2019s not to say that AI-created designs wouldn\u2019t also be possible. To: SunkenCiv If they can do Michaelangelo, they can do McDonalds - let\u2019s keep raising that minimum wage! To: SunkenCiv Old Money hates fine marble sculpture replication in the same way they hate Trump: it attacks their very shaky standing in the social pecking order, the attention they get, their special access to the best. They cannot compete. Really, robot sculpting isn't much different than music replication. Before Edison invented recording technology, average musicians could make a reasonable living playing live in their home towns. Now they are relegated to providing music lessons to the bratty children of the rich, for an hourly minimum wage, while a very few lucky musicians of equal talent make millions of dollars every year through the fickle finger of fate, even after their death. To: Reeses >the fickle finger of fate, And the star-making machinery behind the popular song. Probably more so that. To: SunkenCiv This could actually be a good thing. Instead of relying upon modern art to decorate public spaces/buildings... classical art forms could be utilized. Rather than being channeled into what artists want (and the dismal art they currently produce), robots could open the market to what society wants.

                  "content": "[Music] good evening this is India Global I'm Gori diedi let's start the show with headlines this evening first up foreign secretary Vikram misri in Daka misy says that he's conveyed the minority safety concerns the meeting took play takes place in the backdrop of rising tensions between India and Bangladesh over security of [30.28s] minority communities in [Music] Bangladesh political upheaval in Syria 48 hours later Kremlin says that they have given a political they have given political Asylum to Assad and his family Bashar al-assad remember gave power to the rebels who managed to reach Damascus in less than 14 days Israel meanwhile enters the buffer zone in Golan Heights [60.84s] between Syria and Israeli territory defense minister rajat Singh is in Russia on a three-day visit the visit is aimed at deepening defense ties as India and Russia are set to sign a $4 billion radar system [Music] deal 20-year-old Indian origin man shot dead in Canada last week the Indian student was stabbed [92.76s] to death in Ontario this is the second such death in a [Music] week an Israeli onvoy Rin Azar speaks to NDTV says that Israel is not involved in Syrian conflict says that Iran and its tentacles have been dismantled due to Israel's Onslaught in both Gaza and Lebanon [Music] [128.56s] all right the big story that we're tracking right now is from Bangladesh where foreign secretary vigram misri is in Taka on a dayong visit the visit comes after tensions have been rising between India and Bangladesh over Rising concerns related to minority community that is the Hindu Community not being given fair treatment it is the first high level visit from New Delhi after uh the student Revolution took place on 5th of August Landing to a red carpet welcome on Monday morning mystery was [159.96s] received by senior Bangladeshi foreign Ministry official at the airport Indian High Commissioner P Verma was also present shortly after his arrival misri held talks with his Bangladeshi counterpart that is Muhammad jashim mudin amid strained bilateral ties between the two countries listening to what foreign secretary had to say after that visit today's discussions have given uh both of us the opportunity to take stock of our relations and I appreciate the [190.52s] opportunity today to have had a Frank candid and constructive exchange of views with all my interlocutors I emphasized that India desires a positive constructive and mutually beneficial relationship with Bangladesh we have always seen in the past and we continue to see in the future this relationship as a people Centric and people oriented [221.44s] relationship all right uh during these uh meetings foreign secretary MRI highlighted India's support for a democratic stable peaceful Progressive and most importantly inclusive Bangladesh foreign secretary also discuss certain uh developments that have taken place in the recent past particularly chman Krishna das's uh case that has come up and also conveyed India's concerns particularly those related to safety and Welfare of minorities uh forign secretary raised regrettable incidence of uh attacks on [251.52s] cultural religious and diplomatic properties the nation also exchanged the two sides also exchange views on sub Regional Regional and multilateral issues and agreed to enhance consultation and cooperation to advance Regional integration Missy is also scheduled to pay a cuty visit to Bangladesh interim government Chief adviser Muhammad yunice the Indian foreign secretary's visit comes amids uh tensions between New Deli and taka due to uh which have in fact increased ever since shik H was Ed on the 5th of August [284.36s] meanwhile another case has been launched against uh Hindu religious leader chinma krishnadas who continues to be in jail uh the new charges come following a clash between his followers and the police in the Chittagong Court premises last week Bangladeshi media reports indicate that the case names the Hindu leader as a prime accused along with 164 IND identified individuals and about 400 to 500 unidentified people the complaint alleged that he was attacked by followers of krishnadas while the complainant said that he was attacked by [315.12s] followers of krishnadas while returning home after completing land registry work on 26th of uh November all right uh let's get in my colleague Sor Gupta to fill us in with the very latest on this s appreciate you taking out the time to speak to uh h on India Global the fact is that the relations between India and Bangladesh are very strained and there's expectation that Vikram mis's visit could probably Bridge some of this tension provided Bangladesh gives [346.84s] India's cause a just and an important hearing that's right you know the foreign secretary has obviously raised these issues of continuing attacks on on minorities and specifically the targeting of iscon which is known as a body that's of course you know also uh associated with the Hindu community in Bangladesh as large number of temples they've also come under attack and this is something that obviously will be on the agenda Chino Krishna Das like you mentioned a man who uh should at least [378.72s] have the right to present his side of his case in court but you know we've seen the open threats that's been uh given out to anyone who wants to defend him in court and these are issues that are very basic and these are things that will obviously be part of the talks the ongoing situation in Bangladesh but like the foreign secretary said that there is much more at stake a lot is at stake in the India Bangladesh relationship and uh that includes you know Railway connectivity that includes internet [409.08s] Transit uh that includes a lot of you know uh you know infrastructure movement of goods Commerce across the border uh you know usage of waterways all of these things up part of the entire bilateral relationship and what has happened in the last few days has clearly put a strain on that relationship and when there is so much at stake obviously what India expects is that the government of Bangladesh will do the basic of providing Safety and Security to minorities letting chin krishnadas defend himself in court and also in the [441.36s] past few days we've seen some anti-india elements largely radical elements in the country taking Center States issuing threats issuing threats to the minority Community these are things that the law and autom mechanism in Bangladesh needs to look into protect minorities protect the Hindu community and that's the concrete uh sort of you know structure perhaps of those talks that foreign secretary misri had in Bangladesh but also across the border in neighboring West Bengal mamata banerji again has commented on the issue yes all right s [472.72s] really appreciate you taking out the time and connecting the dots for us there shifting Focus now to the other B story that we are tracking which is uh well the latest that has happened in Syria it's unraveled in the last 48 hours dramatically and after 15 years of a Civil War the final push to overthrow Syria's president Bashar al- Assad took less than 15 days on 8th of December Rebel forces overran the capital Damascus Syrian rebels took Damascus and toppled Assad's regime in a lightning [503.16s] offensive and that's set to reshape the Middle East the overthrow ended the Assad family's 53e rule kept 13 years of brutal Civil War as Government forces melted away footage from Damascus showed Rebel groups entering the presidential Palace escorting the Prime Minister from his home in a sign of the formal transition of power and freeing bewildered Syrian prisoners who had been jailed under Assad's rule the Fallen president has fled to Moscow and he set to be given Asylum there along with his [533.16s] family the Russian media reported while syrians around the world rejoiced meanwhile the European High representative for for foreign affairs has said the end of Syrian President's rule is a positive and long- awaited development it also shows the weakness of Assad's backers that is Russia and Iran but who is fighting home in Syria and why why are so many foreign governments from the US to Russia to Iran to Turkey involved how did Assad's regime survive for so long and what happens now that he's gone well uh what [564.32s] is India's attitude towards Assad and there are millions such questions that remain unanswered it is too early to say if Assad's fall is the end of the Syrian Civil War or just another chapter but this report brings you up to speed with how things stand right [Music] now in less than 2 weeks Syria's history [597.12s] has been altered president B Al Assad whose brutal regime killed tens of thousands and displaced over 7 million internally has fled to Russia after opposition forces romped to Damascus at a lightning Pace Assad's AER has brought in much needed relief to people who spent their lifetime under the nose of the Decades long family regime [627.51s] [Music] the reactions echoed across the globe as thousands of syrians celebrated the fall of Assad singing and waving flags they chanted slogans against the oued Syrian president and his father halfers it's like a tears of happiness like today it's like we didn't imagine I lost my family I lost my father mother [658.36s] brother I lost many of my friends in Syria for this day I wanted to celebrate this day in Syria today meanwhile world leaders have mostly hailed Assad's AER but stop short of celebrating as they seek stability in the waron nation US President Joe Biden has said that it's a historic opportunity but also termed it a moment of risk and un [691.28s] certainty on the other hand India has called for a peaceful and inclusive Syrian Le political process to bring stability to that country meanwhile us president-elect Donald Trump has urg the outgoing us Administration to stay out of the Syria conflict according to reports the US is trying to work out what comes next and who rules over Sy area Washington is worried that the power vacuum could be [723.40s] filled by",

with Iran that I think is going to be extremely important and UK prime minister's visit is very well timed and hours ahead of his meet with u's president starma [912.44s] welcomed the end of Assad's rule as he call for peace and the protection of civilians listen in I welcome the fact that Assad has gone the Civil Syrian people had to put up with his brutal regime for far far too long we're talking to Regional allies it's very important now that there's a political settlement a political Way Forward and it's very very important that we emphasize that civilians and minorities must be protected in this process but [942.88s] very very pleased that Assad has fallen okay uh stama is also set to travel to Saudi Arabia later on Monday for discussions with the Crown Prince uh and St and the Emir of Qatar have agreed on a long-term green energy partnership pledged to deepen defense and security ties and discuss the importance of regional stability as well all right on that note we slip into a very short break we come back on the other side and talk more including defense minister rajat sing's 3-day [975.40s] visit to Russia at a time of such geopolitical movements on that story more after this break stay with us [Music] welcome back you're watching India Global without turn our attention to the other big story on the show which is defense minister rajat Singh's 3-day visit to Russia Singh has arrived in [1006.96s] Moscow in fact he did so Sunday night the visit comes as New Delhi and Moscow are set to finalize a landmark $4 billion defense deal aimed at acquiring an advanced long rate early warning radar system that would be that will strengthen the nation's missile detection and air defense capabilities to understand this the significance of this visit the fact that it's timed at a at a moment when there is so much of geopolitical flux happening in Syria and the entire region let's get in my colleague Vishnu sh to tell us more [1038.52s] about the the visit its significance and what all could be the takeaways for India Co ahead Vishnu explain this to us decode it for us well the big significance today was the commissioning of tushil it's now ins tushil it's a new frigate 10 of2 which is India placed on order with Russia this is of um the the kak 3 class which is a fairly Advanced warship India already operates six of this class all built in Russia uh two have been ordered from Russia and two more of this class have now uh have been [1070.40s] ordered and for manufacturer in India as well I believe they'll be manufactured at at G shipyards but this is a major addition to the Indian Navy now what is interesting and think about this Gori is that the primary engine uh the gas turbine of these frigates is from Ukraine you heard that right they're Ukrainian engines on a Russian warship built for the Indian Navy uh now a large majority of India's naval fleet I'm talking about frigates and destroyers do [1100.56s] use Ukrainian gas turbines uh from a company called uh zarya zarya Masco um but in this particular situation with the war having commenced India had to physically procure these engines from Ukraine and have them delivered to Russia before they could be installed on this warship so it it's been delayed but eventually you are getting the first warship you will get the second warship as well uh but there you have it you know I mean look at the role of India Indian electronics and Indian missiles [1132.36s] on a Russian warship made in Russia with a Ukrainian engine as its primary means of propulsion so that sort of reflects how India is coming at it from various angles indeed and in terms of how it sort of uh improves and really strengthens our defense capabilities if you could tell our viewers the significance of in the shield this particular acquisition is very important because remember India's primary concern in the Indian Ocean region is the growing presence of the Chinese Navy the Chinese Navy is growing [1163.52s] faster than any other Navy in the world uh According to some reports it's already larger than the US Navy and it's not just the the quantity which is significant but the quality of the warships being inducted which is very important as well now India it has to be said is nowhere in the game as far as numbers are concerned but there has been an impetus in the quality of Warships which India is now inducting uh so there is a a state-of-the-art Indian frigate the iist nilgiri which in the next couple of weeks will be commissioned in Mumbai there is this warship which has [1194.12s] been commissioned in Russia as well the acquisition of each platform is very very very very important there has been an uptick in the acquisition of Warships with the Indian Navy there's a gigantic order for submarines which is also expected but that's taken almost 10 years we've not seen the light of day and it's still to be signed and then of course there's the entire nuclear side of things where we've got at least three ballistic missile submarines with Advanced missile tests now being conducted so the Indian Navy is in a period of huge growth unfortunately for [1225.28s] India it pales in significance to the volume of the growth that we've seen with the Chinese Navy indeed and and Before I Let You Go V the fact is this visit uh of course planned months in advance but one can't miss the timing happening at a time when Assad and his family have taken Asylum or set to take asylum in Russia um in the entire region in that entire Syrian uh developments Russia has really taken uh backseat there and and it impacts its presence do you think that's likely to come up uh in [1256.60s] the negotiations or talks between India and Russia any reference to that no I don't",

easy to do I think those are the primary issues that India and Russia would be looking at all right Vish sh appreciate you taking out the time to speak to us on India Global shifting Focus now to a story coming in from Canada where a 20-year-old Indian origin man working as a security guard was shot dead by a gang in Canada's Edgmont area in fact the police have arrested two individuals and charged them with first murder of the [1319.80s] Indian origin man harand deep Singh and the CCTV footage uh that is available it shows the murder took place on Friday as per the police uh it happened at around 12:30 in the night and they responded to a report of a gunshot inside an apartment building when they reached 107 Avenue they found that an unresponsive body in a stevil and immediately performed first aid Mr Singh was taken to the hospital where he was declared dead this is the second death case of an [1350.52s] Indian origin in Canada in the last one week news coming in from China an extremely important news China State Administration for Market regulation or samr has introduced that it has opened an investigation into Nvidia corporations business practices this over the company's alleged violations of that country's anti-monopoly regulations the PO probe comes amidst the supposed violations Nvidia could have committed VI acquiring computer parts supply [1380.68s] melanex Technologies the chipmaker purchased melanex in 2020 with approval from the respective Anti-Trust agencies from China the EU and the us all right with that we slip into a short break uh we come back on the other side with an important interview and lots more stay with us [Music] the last 48 hours there have been unprecedented developments in Syria [1413.56s] something that's said to impact the entire region Middle East and of course the World At Large as well to understand the Dynamics how it could reshape some of the global world order and how it could reshape political developments around the world I have with me uh the ambassador of Israel to India Mr ruin AAR speaking on what could be the next steps for the region for Israel and how significant it could be to reshape that entire area thank you so much uh Excellency for taking out the time speaking Tov for the interiew my first [1443.68s] question to you as we talk about the unprecedented developments in Syria is that uh of course Israel is not a stakeholder and what all happened but it gets impacted because it's an important uh development that has taken place uh talk to us about how Israel is seeing how these changes have taken place in Syria and how they're set to reshape that entire region well Israel is no doubt in a situation of alert uh we are following very closely the events in Syria uh the Israel Defense [1473.96s] Forces have taken defensive positions in the buffer zone in the border between Israel and Syria as you probably know there is a disengagement zone that was created in 1974 following the Yon kipur War uh that zone U is a buffer zone of one several hundred meters to few kilometers in the north um in the past that area was attacked uh by different groups it has been attacked now to the UN forces there The Observers that [1505.00s] belong to organization called unov have been attacked Israel has come to their rescue so we are taking this temporary defensive positions in the buffer zone and following very closely what's going on on the other side preparing to defend ourselves against any uh possible attack or development there is there is this sense that uh I see uh and and several leaders are also talking about it that uh Israel has sort of uh preempted some of what his developments are happening or some are saying that Israel is trying to take [1536.92s] advantage of a very volatile situation explain to us that uh is this a temporary B uh from a security point of view why was it necessary well as you know Israel was attacked on the 7th of October and that decision to attack Israel I think was uh a decision that not only caused huge damage to Israel we had to defend ourselves U but it also had a you know it had an effect in the region because from the moment [1567.12s] thatal decided to involve itself in the conflict and attacking Israel from the north it was just a matter of time until Israel would have to take the necessary steps to defend ourselves so I think that Iran Andis balah made a huge miscalculation uh they didn't understand what are going to be the consequences of their attack against Israel kbal has been hit very hard Nala as you remember was taken out many with many thousands of hisbah terrorists uh Iran attacked [1597.16s] Israel directly and as you know Israel defended itself and attacked Iran back so when you look at the picture you see that these tentacles of the Iranian uh regime have been cut but in that the re yeah balah and now uh forces in the region that have been following that and seeing the debilitation of the Iran axis took advantage of it and that's how you see the change in Syria Israel is not [1628.00s] involved in the Syrian conflict we are not intending to involve ourselves in Syrian politics uh and that's a matter that the Syrian people will have to sort out itself but the fact that the Israeli forces entered the buffer zone I was asking about that that uh is it temporary what was the rationale for it because that is that is something that a lot of people are asking that wasn't needed at this moment it is temporary and it wasn't needed it was needed because as you remember and maybe your audience doesn't remember that back in [1658.16s] 2010 when the civil war in Syria started we had a situation in which Isis related groups and other groups entered into the buffer zone and used that buffer zone in order to um entrench themselves fight against the Assad regime and also from time to time attack Israel so we had to take care of that okay it took us a lot of effort to clean the buffer zone from this elements that were using the border with Israel [1689.20s] as a shield from the B bombardments of the Assad regime towards them and some of this uh missiles fell in Israel territory so now we had to make sure that this buffer zone is not utilized again as an entrenchment for Rog terrorist elements do you anticipate that given the fact that uh though yes there's been a regime change Assad government has fallen but those who are now set to take power are also offshoots [1719.44s] of al-Qaeda they also you know have extreme islamist ideology they may have disown some of the al-Qaeda thought but are unlikely to be completely of a different uh thought process there do you anticipate Rogue you're right that there are many Rogue elements in the in the Middle East there are many radicals some of them are shite radical some of them are Sunni radicals in Syria as well so we are learning from the past we saw in the past that we were attacked by such Rogue elements we don't want that to repeat itself we don't know what is [1750.88s] going to happen in Syria who is going to take control how long this is going to take until they take effective control what will be their approach towards Israel yes so naturally we are in a defensive position without interfering in Syrian politics but alert to the scenario that we will be attacked fine that is a defense and a national security point of view uh Israel is not involved in the Syrian politics it is of course going to be impacted like the other uh people as [1781.84s] well in the region but what about Iran the developments in Syria are having or set to have a major impact on Iran as well that impacts Israel directly doesn't it well as I said Iran did a huge miscalculation it",

Syrian politics but alert to the scenario that we will be attacked fine that is a defense and a national security point of view uh Israel is not involved in the Syrian politics it is of course going to be impacted like the other uh people as [1781.84s] well in the region but what about Iran the developments in Syria are having or set to have a major impact on Iran as well that impacts Israel directly doesn't it well as I said Iran did a huge miscalculation it is now exposed not only by the fact that their tentacles three of them were cut now okay but also by the fact that we have proven that they are not immune that if they attack Israel they will be attacked [1812.04s] so uh in our counter attack we removed their air defenses we hit uh their missile and drone factories and we even hit an element of their nuclear program so if they decide to continue the escalation against Israel of course Israel will remain the right to defend itself do you think that this will weaken hisbah significantly because Iran may not be able to rearm Hezbollah that much and that will have a direct impact um on Israel's security and [1842.84s] strategic calculations yeah look there are different geopolitical uh changes that are going to happen as a result of what we did to remove Hamas andala and what is going now in Syria we don't know yet all the implications but you can see very clearly at this point that first of all these tentacles are removed second that apparently I don't know yet whether it's final or not the Russian military presence in Syria is [1873.16s] going to come to an end and that changes the state of play in the Eastern Mediterranean when it comes to the balance between Russia and NATO okay uh and the the third thing is that uh turkey and to a certain extent Qatar that are supporting these Rebels are going to feel encouraged to try to shape the future of Syria maybe other Arab states we don't know yet so we have to contemplate that Israel is present in the in the region I think Israel made it [1903.40s] very clear that we will not agree to be attacked by anybody uh and those who decided to attack us paid a huge price so this is going to influence also not only what is happening in Syria but it's going what is the power play in Lebanon as well we don't know how at this point as you know we are positioned on the other side on the libanes side on the border of the Border we are trying to implement the ceasefire that we have with the government of Lebanon we are not going to allow kbal [1935.92s] to go back to the border with Israel so there as well we're taking positions waiting to see what is going to happen uh but I think that by now it is very clear to different players in the region including these terrorist organizations that Israel is very Resolute to defend itself and I hope that they don't decide to attack several questions coming from that and I'm going to take them one by one but first the reason why I asked Iran is the fact that uh Beirut to [1966.44s] Damascus has been a very important Corridor for Iran in the past as well and and and that has been important for Hezbollah as well do you see that Corridor now being closed for Iran and that having a larger implication for hisbah and also for Lebanon people as well Lebanese people stand to get impacted as well do you think that is now going to be the largest and the most obvious takeaway from uh Iranian ability or lack of ability to help Hezbollah it seems that in the immediate future this Corridor was uh taken out uh I don't [1999.24s] know what will be the future relations between the Syrian government and the Iranian government it's too early to say uh it seems that there is uh a conflict in the region between Sunni and Shiite radical forces yes um and uh Israel has been subject to attack by both in the past so uh it's not that you know we we wish that we would see a situation in Syria that uh we have peace our prime [2029.28s] minister has gone out with a very clear statement that we are sending a message of Peace both to the uh Kurds to the Drews to the Christians and the Muslims in Syria and we wish to have peaceful relations with Syria yes uh the question is what will be the approach of the new government as as when it shapes up and also this is likely to be a Sunni government and uh Iranians of course are Shia majority and and that could of [2060.16s] course create more uh Regional I wouldn't say conflict maybe tensions that remain to be seen how they pan out but let me then ask you about the ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon there have been violations but there's also hope that some of it could pan out do you think now are you or is Israel now more optimistic that the ceasefire chances of it being uh totally fulfilled by Lebanon are higher given the fact that Hezbollah may not be rearmed that much by Iran at least in the immediate we are we are very cautious here um we [2093.32s] think that the Lebanese government is not moving fast enough uh we have seen attempts byala operatives to go south to the Lani to move weapons from place to place each time that we saw things like that we took immediate action yes this is a responsibility of the Lebanese government and Israel will not rest until the terms of this ceas fire are completely implemented yes and that means that if the Lebanese government won't act against hisb South of the Lani [2123.76s] Israel will be obliged to do so and this is very clearly stated also in the side letter that we got from the Americans we have a right to defend ourselves we won't allow a situation which isala comes back to our border yes and we won't allow his Bala to fire at Northern Israel if you remember the aim that the cabinet has clearly uh defined is that we must allow our citizens the citizens that were approv approved from the [2156.36s] border area Villages about 60,000 of them to return safely to their homes if they feel that this ceasefire is not perpetuated they won't go back so we need to stabilize the region it's either done by the libanese government or it will have to be done by [Music] Israel are you now or is Israel now more [2188.60s] hopeful that ceasefire violations by by hisbah will be less given given the complexities right now well yeah it's clear thatal has been debilitated and in this situation we have to recalibrate how Brazen wants to be when it comes to provocations against Israel we certainly hope that the new situation will be more favorable to stability and that's what we are thriving for there are some reports or there are some an ists who expect that given the [2220.08s] very dramatic changes that have taken place from Iran's political point of view as well in the region that and and the power imbalance that has suddenly taken place for it it may probably now pursue the nuclear program with a new Zeal to be able to arrest some of the power imbalance that has taken place in the last 48 hours against it how does Israel respond to that well as you probably know the prime minister of Israel has cleared very uh very clear clearly has declared very clearly that [2251.88s] Israel will not allow Iran to arm itself with a nuclear weapon and we are Resolute to follow that decision we have the tools of doing that as if as and if you have seen in the past we have shown that Iran is vulnerable and is exposed so I think that it's about time that the Iranian regime understands that they should change their approach towards Israel and if they pursue such a path it [2282.36s] will be very dangerous for the regime and the reason the reason why I asked you this is because there's also there is a power vacuum in Syria and there is also a regional uh competition between turkey and Iran so in the backdrop of that uh these changes that have taken place in the geopolitical scenario in the last a couple of days are going to have Major Impact and they will decide decision-making both for turkey both for Iran and several other players in your assessment where do you see this power vacuum leading up to um over the course [2314.36s] of next couple of weeks couple of months because longer than that I think it's impossible to predict right now well we have a saying in in Jewish tradition that prophecy since the the end of era of Prophecy prophecy is only given to the fools so I'm not going to uh be prophetic I don't know what will happen in Syria I don't know uh what will be the next moves of turkey or Iran uh but there must have been some internal assessments right some some well there are people that are",

pursue such a path it [2282.36s] will be very dangerous for the regime and the reason the reason why I asked you this is because there's also there is a power vacuum in Syria and there is also a regional uh competition between turkey and Iran so in the backdrop of that uh these changes that have taken place in the geopolitical scenario in the last a couple of days are going to have Major Impact and they will decide decision-making both for turkey both for Iran and several other players in your assessment where do you see this power vacuum leading up to um over the course [2314.36s] of next couple of weeks couple of months because longer than that I think it's impossible to predict right now well we have a saying in in Jewish tradition that prophecy since the the end of era of Prophecy prophecy is only given to the fools so I'm not going to uh be prophetic I don't know what will happen in Syria I don't know uh what will be the next moves of turkey or Iran uh but there must have been some internal assessments right some some well there are people that are trying to assess the [2345.16s] situation at the end of the day in such a degree of volatility you cannot know what will happen I think that the fact that turkey is a NATO member yes although not always it has been behaving like a NATO member but the fact that it's a NATO member I think it's it works in favor of NATO uh I think that the fact that Iran uh is no longer presence uh in the in the scope it was present in Syria or in Lebanon is something that is favorable for Israel but [2376.56s] again we have to be alert uh we don't know what will be the attitude of the forces are taking over in Syria We Wish For Peace we want to stabilize the region um and we hope that the Syrian people will concentrate in rebuilding their country instead of uh you know using violence against Israel last uh two questions I want to ask you one is that will will this now lead to a push towards getting the war over you know [2407.96s] there is of course Hezbollah with Hezbollah there is a ceasefire but with Hamas the war continues do you think these changed uh conditions will be ripe for uh for ending the war with Hamas as well do you see that we certainly hope so we think that there is uh pressure being put on Hamas the the fact that their main Patron Iran has uh received those blows I think uh might get them to rethink their position we are not going [2438.44s] to compromise on getting back all our hostages and we are not going to allow Hamas to rearm and regroup in the Gaza street so it's a tough situation because what Hamas wants from us is to use the hostages card in order to create a situation in which can gain back control over the entire G strip rearm regroup and attack Israel we won't allow that so we have to be patient we have to work with our allies and friends we have to [2469.68s] continue putting pressure on Hamas until they are no longer the leading force in the god strip and until they completely release all our hostages in 14 months of the war this is probably the time when Iran and some of its proxy network is at its weak guest so one would say this is probably the best time to evaluate uh the prospects of ending that war is that a conversation that's happening internally right now in is what we have seen uh in the last few days is that the [2501.72s] Prime Minister has met with the families of the hostages yesterday and actually has said that you know the time is ripe for a hostage deal so we certainly hope to see developments in the future uh I don't know what will happen with uh the continuation of hostilities with the sporadic efforts of the Hamas terrorist organization to continue uh you know their attack against our forces uh this is an ongoing effort I don't know when [2534.16s] this will end but it seems that the conditions have improved when it comes to the prospects of having a hostage deal sooner than later final question sir it's 6 weeks before president-elect Donald Trump comes into power and he's been very vocal about the fact that he wants to end this war he's he's hopeful that it'll end on day one conditions if they are as they continue till then in your assessment uh where do you see the War ending in terms I know the conditions are known you know you you've you've highlighted them right now as [2564.60s] well but with the change of God in us happening and so how do you see that impacting the war well first of all I think that if the ceire in the north holds that means that uh the Maj 90% of the of of the stability we need to maintain uh our economy to open up you know the Skies of Israel uh to go back to normal life are there what is still left once we have neutralize the Hamas military threat the missile threat um [2597.48s] and uh and and their infrastructure uh the only thing that is left is to bring back the hostages and make sure that Hamas doesn't rearm and regroup from the point of view of the Israel economy things are back on track the Israel economy is very robust uh tourism is coming back so so I think it's not dependent on a official ceasefire with Hamas um and the straling in the Gaza Strip is not going to be over until a horizon for Gaza is created that is [2629.64s] conducive with the hopes of the both of Israel and the Palestinian people right because what they have been suffering in the last 17 years of Hamas rule is terrible and that has to change so when are we going to see the conditions in which we can develop a plan together with our partners for the Palestinians to assume a more moderate leadership and actually start reconstructing Gaza we don't have answers for that yet but the power dynamics have changed right now some of those who are very strong are not not so [2660.60s] strong right now in the last couple of days and do you think that makes the conditions right because it's not just about us it's also about the region and and some of the region leaders look I think no doubt it improved the prospects and there is something very clear that we can see right now that if you attempt to destroy Israel you will be destroyed and this is a very important message that is sent by the developments that we see in the region all right sir thank you so much for taking out the time and [2691.60s] speaking to NTV thank you thank you thank you very much

it's a moment of historic opportunity we break down what it means for Syria the region and the world Donald Trump talks tariffs and his dinner with the Prime Minister I spoke with Justin Udo in fact he flew to [31.40s] maralago uh within about 15 seconds after the call and it's the end of the eras tour this is probably the biggest concert tour that's the world has ever seen Taylor Swift plays one last show in Vancouver from CBC News this is the national with Ian henan Bashar al-assad is no longer Syria's dictator Russia says he's now in Exile in Moscow the regime that rules [62.04s] Syria for decades suddenly Swept Away Rebels celebrated on the streets of Damascus trampling symbols of the regime they ransacked Assad's home and took over State media while burning buildings linked to the security apparatus the leader of the Rebel Coalition hailing this Victory as a new chapter for the region CBC News is following reaction across the region and around the globe we begin with Margaret Evans who is in neighboring Lebanon tonight [92.40s] this is Syria at the Turning of the page the past in flames and A New Hope Rising as news spread that Bashar alassad had fled the country people took to the streets in Jubilation after all the years of dictatorship we've lived through we were in prison says this man and now we're out and at the moment where we're going to build the greatest [122.72s] Syria that's what this man is promising them arriving in Damascus to speak at the great mosque the main Rebel leader Abu Muhammad Al jalani an islamist who Marshall desperate Rebel factions to end more than 50 years of brutal dictatorship under the alassad [Applause] family he called the feat a turning point for the region he also promised healing for a country soaked in [154.20s] loss this woman says 13 years of al-asad's repression has cost her dearly my cousin my son my family all all all of them the rebels arriving in Damascus freed some of the prisoners from the Sadaya prison as they've done in other cities al-assad's jails block holes of [184.88s] torture and death into which the regime's opponents often disappeared elsewhere in the city there was looting some residents finding themselves in the presidential Palace helping themselves to a few souvenirs former prime minister Muhammad gazi Al jalali who said he wouldn't leave the capital has been designated as a trans transitional figure by the rebels clearly eager to present themselves as a group with a plan also [216.80s] aimed at calming Regional [Music] concerns celebrating the demise of the al-assad regime weren't confined to Syria these were the scenes in neighboring Lebanon the Border crammed with syrians eager to return home after years of Exile Muhammad sria hasn't seen his family since fleeing the country 8 years ago he [247.28s] says all syrians will now be safe because the one who threatened them is gone and Ian Russian State News agencies are reporting that al-assad is now in Moscow and has been given Asylum marget there's still lots of questions about what comes next for Syria are people worried some are of course but many really are focusing on the need to acknowledge today as a moment the the end of a [279.24s] barbaric regime one that has used Barrel bombs on its civilians chemical weapons laid whole cities Under Siege they really want to feel the importance of what's happened and acknowledge it now Margaret Evans in Beirut tonight Bashar al-assad's stunning downfall is being felt AC Ross the Middle East tonight both his allies and enemies confronting this new reality in the region to Syria's East Iran was a key Ally of Assad helping to prop up his [309.36s] rule for years which is one reason why to the South Israel has been hostile to Assad but it was Turkey to the north that backed the rebels that toppled his regime and are now in control of most of the country Tom Perry is in Jerusalem tracking the reaction as Syria's role in the Middle East changes quickly while syrians across the Middle East who were forced from their homes by their country's Civil War or fear of a brutal regime celebrated the downfall of Bashar [341.00s] al-assad Syria's neighbors were taking stock of a radical shift in the Region's political balance millions of syrians who were forced to leave their homes can return to their land turkey which backed the opposition to the Assad regime is urging calm the new Administration must be established in an orderly manner the principle of inclusiveness must never be compromise Iran's government a staunch Assad Ally [371.72s] issued a statement calling for the Swift end of military conflicts the prevention of terrorist actions and the commencement of national dialogue with all sectors of Syrian society qar and Egypt are calling for Unity and a preservation of the Syrian state and National institutions the fear that opposition factions could further Splinter the country and plunge it even deeper into chaos Israel has sent troops into a buffer zone along its border with [403.76s] Syria to monitor temporarily it says the situation on the other side Israel's prime minister at the same time taking credit for weakening the Assad regime and hastening its downfall this collapse is a direct result of our forceful action against hisis balah and Iran Assad's main supporters it set off a chain reaction of all those who want to free themselves from this tyranny and its suppression the Israeli military is continuing its air strikes in Syria [435.24s] reportedly targeting arms facilities and ammunition Depots looking to keep the weapons of a now fallen regime from falling into the hands of anyone who might use them against Israel Tom Perry CBC News jerus Jem and the Ripple effects of Assad's downfall could extend well beyond the Middle East as Ellen Morrow explains Europe the US and Canada are all watching closely to see what happens next at Syrian embassies around the world the rebel forces flag already [467.36s] flies this ground swell of Celebration tinged with trepidation for global leaders it's a moment of historic opportunity for the longsuffering people of Syria to build a better future for their proud country it's also a moment of risk and uncertainty a sentiment echoed in European capitals and from Ottawa prime minister Justin Trudeau welcoming the fall of Assad's dictatorship adding Canada urges order stability and respect for human rights the main thing right [498.12s] now is just to make sure people are safe and secure trying to get to a period of stability is really the critical first first step while Rebel leader Abu Muhammad Al jalani has projected ties to extremism now promising an inclusive future for all syrians he and his fighting forces have their roots in al-Qaeda splintered factions across Syria and lingering Isis presence all adding to a complicated mix disengagement right now is not an option [528.80s] because when you have a vacuum that's when the Bad actors come back actors the West fears like Iran and Russia both spent billions propping up a all of that has come to nothing now they've they've lost their most important Ally in the region and I think this changes the entire geopolitical landscape for the Middle East the West is now considering its next steps the UN insisting Syria's future must be decided by syrians [559.48s] themselves if the government that emerges from this transition in Syria is in fact more pluralist more open more inclusive I would hope Western governments and the American government would be willing to invest in and support but first comes the long awaited and daunting task for syrians to chart their own path forward Ellen Morrow CBC News Toronto Canada has welcomed tens of thousands of refugees fleeing the Syrian Civil War and so the fall of the Assad [590.08s] regime has touched off celebrations here too Lisa Shing brings us the hopes that so many now hold for the future a long awaited celebration for a community

dignity um and freedom that they deserve nearly 14 years of unrest [622.08s] and Civil War left half a million people dead and pushed millions of others to flee tens of thousands said settled here in Canada many of them now coming together from Vancouver to winnan to St John's to start the process of healing from Decades of rule under the Assad family so there is so much generational trauma for some of us it's our parents for some started with our grandparents even though the future is uncertain there's a lot of Hope here about what [653.36s] comes next especially since almost everyone here has a personal story a connection to the suffering Amir fatal came here as a refugee 8 years ago and has been watching the news closely we are worried about the chaos and who going to lead the country but um um I'm I'm laying uh on the you know the smart people and the great uh politician the Syrian politicians all around the world and for many mixed with the uncertainty of this moment is a clear

weekend's events could tilt the balance of power across the Middle East Donald Trump is calling for an immediate ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine Trump made the comments online hours after meeting Ukraine's president in Paris Trump wrote Vladimir zalinski and Ukraine would like to make a deal and stop the madness in response zalinsky wrote a ceasefire without guarantees can be reignited at any moment a Kremlin spokesperson says [747.36s] Russia is open to talks but Ukraine refuses to negotiate in his first Network TV interview since the election Trump is doubling down on his tariff threats Katie Simpson now with what he said about Canada the Prime Minister and their recent dinner together prime minister Justin Trudeau's quick visit to maral Lago we've heard plenty about it from the Canadian perspective now president-elect Donald Trump is offering his version of how it all came together I spoke with Justin [778.32s] Trudeau in fact he flew to maralago uh within about 15 seconds after the call ended in this sitdown interview with NBC News Trump reaffirmed his commitment to tariffs sharing what he says he told the Prime Minister I said you have to close up your borders because they're coming in the northern border too a lot not like the southern border but they're coming in the Canadian border a lot and drugs are pouring in almost as importantly drug supporing and maybe more importantly adding to Trump's broad list of complaints he's also also [809.40s] criticizing trade deficits though he exaggerated the numbers roughly doubling them to make his point we're subsidizing Canada to the tune of over a a hundred billion do a year we're subsidizing Mexico for almost $300 billion if we're going to subsidize him let it become a state that becoming a state comment is now a recurring theme it follows what was interpreted as a joke during the mara Lago dinner where Trump said Canada can be the 51st state if tariffs destroy the economy and after this post on [841.92s] Trump's social media platform there's nothing to suggest Trump is serious about that but those who know him say he's dead serious about tariffs I think one of the things that people around the world know about Donald Trump is that um he he will follow through with things like this Trump also offered fresh insight into his broader foreign policy plans warning Ukraine should probably expect less us support while remaining non-committal on NATO they're paying their bills and if I think they're doing [873.52s] a fair if they're treating us fairly the answer is absolutely I'd stay with NATO but if not you would consider the possibility of absolutely yeah absolutely what's getting the most attention in the US is Trump's promise to Pardon January 6th riers and his desire for revenge against the lawmakers who investigated him for what they did yeah honestly they should go to jail Trump says he's not not going to direct authorities to investigate his political opponents instead it'll be up to his new [903.92s] attorney general and FBI director but they have been very clear about going after Trump's opponents Trump generated a lot of headlines in that interview how are officials in Ottawa interpreting what he said I'm told what Trump said matches what he said privately at Mara Lago according to a senior Canadian government Source the Canadian strategy Remains the Same the Canada US cabinet committee meets Monday and the Prime Minister plans to schedule another call with Canada's Premier to provide them an update this week Katie Simpson in [934.44s]

Vancouver the fall of Bashar al-assad's regime is prompting questions about Syria's future how we got here why the stakes are high for several Nations five foreign countries have a military [1315.08s] presence in Syria and why what happens next is critical for the region there are opportunities here to put the region on a much more stable footing the national breaks down the story shaping our world [Music] next everyone survived but there were some scary moments in Palm Springs this weekend when a police motorcycle crashed into a group of people it happened at [1346.92s] the Annual Festival of Lights Parade when the officer was apparently trying to pop a wheelie 10 people were injured and were helped out by other First Responders who were also taking part in the parade just this past week alone two big food recalls cucumbers and kale salad kits both over salmonella concerns so we asked Jennifer Yun whether there more recalls than usual and here's what she found out carrots cucumbers and sweet kale salad at some [1377.68s] point over the last few weeks all of these items have been recalled the fear risk of contamination from things like salmonella or eoli so why does this keep happening sometimes we forget that food comes from farms and food comes from nature food can get contaminated in all kinds of ways while it's being processed like this or in the field in areas close to manure recalls tend to ramp up in the winter as we rely on Imports food [1408.52s] produced in Canada is very safe but we don't make a lot of cucumbers in December in Canada so we do have to rely on imported fresh veggies in Canada and we do tend to see a couple more outbreaks associated with those imported products but while it may feel to some like there are more recalls this year that's just not the case there's some more consumer awareness or they're being shared on social media we're we're not seeing an increase in food recalls right now I'm thinking that it's heightened awareness and and uh more rigorous [1441.28s] testing and some even say more recalls would actually reflect a better detection system because that means that those things are getting caught before they make people sick most of the time in Canada companies voluntarily recall the food after they conduct their tests preventing more outbreaks could involve new decontamination methods as well as cracking down on delinquent companies some people suggests that litigation like in the US they're really strict now [1472.84s] they're actually calling for prosecutions of CEOs we haven't got that far in Canada it's also important to assess your own risk be aware that some products have a higher risk of contamination Jennifer Yun CBC News Toronto now let's dig deeper into our top story The ousting of a brutal regime crowds Revel in the streets of Syria celebrating the end of President Bashar [1504.60s] al-assad and his family's half century of iron rule Rebel forces are forced Assad to resign his office flee the country it follows a lightning speed Rebel offensive that seized control of the country's capital it's simply astonishing it's it's mind-boggling it's hard to process in fact the latest chapter in a Civil War which until a couple of weeks ago lay seemingly dormant for years so why did Syria's long simmering struggle reignite Chris Brown breaks [1534.88s] down how the situation unravel and the key players fighting for control after years of lame dormant the 13e civil war in Syria suddenly became Dynamic again with events shifting almost by the hour an ending with opposition forces overthrowing president Bashar al-assad in just 11 days it began with the rapid fall of [1566.36s] Aleppo Syria's second largest city Aleppo saw some of the worst fighting of Syria's civil war which began in 2011 Assad spent four years trying to wrestle control of Aleppo from Rebel forces eventually succeeding in 2016 with the help of Russia and what many believe was a turning point in the conflict but this time Aleppo fell within ours but why has Syria's War reignited [1599.72s] now these are the key players Basher alad's family is Syria's main political Dynasty ruthlessly ruling the country for over 50 years Assad took over from his father in 2000 11 years later he faced a major challenge to his rule from largely peaceful protesters associated with the Arab Spring his Crackdown against them evolved into a fullscale Civil [1634.44s] War the opposition groups that recaptured Aleppo hamama and in the end Damascus are led by hayat Tahir alham or HTS which controlled nearly all of idlib province it was initially an offshoot of al-Qaeda but lately its leader Abu Muhammad Al jalani has been talking about religious tolerance he told CNN his goal is to topple Assad and create a government for [1664.72s] all syrians five foreign countries have a military presence in Syria the United States turkey Iran Russia and Israel this analyst says it was was Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon that upended the situation in Syria uh the group uh which uh supported Assad for many years had to uh remove uh and relocate some of its forces and [1695.48s] Fighters as well as assets back to Lebanon in order to uh protect its uh uh territories there against an Israeli offensive Russia has long supported Assad's regime regime It joined the Syrian government forces in Fierce air strikes on Aleppo and other cities but now appears to have evacuated much of its military force from the country whatever victories Russia was able to achieve in the past [1725.68s] whether those are military victories or symbolic SL political victories those were temporary now we are in a different phase when it comes to its ability to project power Iran also supported Assad during the Civil War and sent in its militias to help fight the rebels then there's turkey which backs groups of rebels near its border with Syria and wants millions of Syrian refugees inside turkey to be returned the United States [1756.64s] supports the Kurdish Syrian Democratic forces who want autonomy within Syria which turkey's government opposes and finally there are remnants of the Islamic State in Syria while badly weakened it could try to take advantage of the chaos to regroup we will also continue to maintain our presence in eastern Syria which is solely to ensure the enduring defeat of Isis and has nothing to do with other aspects of this conflict Syria's 13-year Civil War has [1788.40s] already created an immense Refugee crisis upending politics in Europe even impacting Canada's 2015 election when Justin Trudeau made resettling syrians one of his main promises 25,000 more Syrian refugees already there are worrying signs the humanitarian situation is rapidly deteriorating

forces Syria's president to flee ending his family's more than five Decades of repressive rule it is a good thing that Assad has gone a very good thing for the Syrian people the world watches while syrians celebrate the seismic political shift it's a moment of historic opportunity for the longsuffering of Syria so what does Syria's future look [1952.08s] like let's bring in ner hashimi he's with Georgetown University and Steven heidman with the Brookings Institution for Middle East policy both have been watching this very closely and N let's start with with how momentous this is describe that for us it's tough to describe in words um when I'm hearing from my Syrian friends and colleagues is it feels like a dream uh no one thought that this could happen uh so quickly so it's a huge moment of Celebration uh and optimism about the future uh that this 54-year-old you know [1983.96s] brutal dictatorship was uh toppled so quickly and so effectively and so huge uh emotions now um optimism about the future for what uh the future might hold but also a lot of concern as well and speaking of emotion and optimism Stephen you know people who fled Syria who maybe wondered at one point uh if they would ever get to go back now they're talking about wanting to do exactly that that's right many of the people that I know who who left the country to avoid the repression of the Assad regime some [2016.64s] even decades before the start of the Syrian Uprising in 2011 are so excited and and just are feeling so much joy at the prospect of being able to return one friend sent me a picture of her house that that she looks forward to returning to and and she said the house is tattered but still standing and I took that to be a pretty nice metaphor for syrians as a whole n when we talked earlier today on CBC radio and we heard this from some callers as well [2048.00s] about the notorious prisons in Syria with their doors now suddenly flung open talk to us a little bit about that I mean this is one of the characteristics of the um the house of Assad particularly the sun um you know the notorious prison system there is this you know one prison out side of Damascus known as Sida prison that was described in a 2017 uh Amnesty International report as a human slaughterous I just heard reports the other just about 105 minutes ago that [2079.76s] while they've freed many of the prisoners that were in that prison they're still discovering layers upon layers of of prison cells that they haven't been able to open yet uh and that's just one prison among many and I'm also hearing reports that you know people are discovering new prisons that did they didn't know exist so this is you know I think um both a characteristic of the old regime and the joy and Elation of seeing these people reunited with their families discovering that some who thought were dead are still alive is you know part of this this this momentous uh moment in Syrian [2111.44s] history that that we're experiencing so Steph certainly we're seeing it in in the emotions of people in Syria and we're hearing it actually from governments around the world much to celebrate here with the end of the Assad regime but at the same time describe for us what the presid looks like how how stable how how uh Fair do you think the the present leadership whatever that leadership is going to turn into how how how safe it will be well sure there's enormous concern [2141.84s] about whether Syria will be stable in the future and that's understandable but what's striking I think is just how smooth and just how effective the first few days of this transition well the first two days of this transition have been we've seen the prime minister of the of the the Assad uh government remain in place he told syrians he would be back in his office this morning he called on public sector employees to return to their jobs the uh the the uh Coalition that led the offensive against [2173.72s] Assad has instituted a curfew to try to Tamp down potential violence or chaos following the toppling of of the Assad regime we've seen enormous Outreach to sectarian minorities including the aloise including Christians and we're hearing reports from Christians in Aleppo for example that they feel more secure and safer now than they did under the Assad regime so the initial indications very early days but the initial indications are of a surprisingly smooth transition process [2204.68s] that's underway and we have to hope that that continues and that that the groups that led the the military operation will continue to use good judgment and how they organize this transition on the political side and N what do you think what's the likelihood that good judgment will be used over the next few months well I think we can hope that there will be good judgment but you know the future of Syria is not going to be judged simply by the good intentions of its key political actors as anyone who studied [2235.16s] political change or revolutions know that the highest moment of unity and common purpose and tranquility and inclusiveness is in the leadup to uh the transition and in the immediate days afterwards uh inevitably syrians are going to struggle with what every Revolution struggles with and that is um how do you establish um a new political order how inclusive will it be and there will be uh we can what what will what we will inevitably see is you know power struggles and competitions for um uh [2266.60s] political power that you know it it's uncertain how this is going to play out but those things are inbuilt in any sort of monumentous political transformation that uh uh that takes place including the one in Syria so I don't think we should have you know unrealistic unrealistic expectations I don't think syrians are you know any different than any other people undergoing such a Monumental political transformation they're going to have to struggle with uh these types of compromises like any other people caught up in such a revolutionary moment let's talk about stability in the region I'll ask each of [2298.40s] you this starting with Stephen um are we any steps closer do you think to to more stability outside of Syria but in the region of Syria because of what's happened here you know I I suspect that across Capitals in in the broader Middle East uh leaders are very involved thinking about what their next step should be about what the overthrow of the Assad regime means for their interests this is a period of of tremendous uncertainty for regional actors I think there are [2329.60s] some trends that are clear that could potentially lead the region into uh uh some period of of even greater instability but could also go in the other direction one of those has to do with the retreat of Iran and the weakening of Iran's Regional influence as a result of the loss of the Assad regime another has to do with the difficulties that hisb will now encounter in trying to reconstitute itself given that Iran can no longer [2360.20s] make use of Syria as a transit route to resupply hisbah we have millions of refugees around the region who may well be anxious to return home and that process I think holds out a lot of Hope but I suspect that governments in the region will be worried about managing it in a way that that doesn't uh lead to to chaos or instability so we have we have a number of factors we're seeing a really Monumental shift in the geopolitics of the region unfolding in [2390.60s] in front of our eyes and and we'll just have to see how that develops but but my sense is that that there are opportunities here to put the region on a much more stable footing and that'll depend on how Arab regimes neighboring Syria respond to the the current context and N why don't you jump in on that same question about are we a step closer to to more stability in a region that hasn't seen a lot of that recently yeah it remains to be seen I I I share um the Brad outlines that Steven [2422.44s] has just suggested there's always spoilers in a moment like this so I'm very very worried about groups like Isis who want to cause chaos you know exploding bombs and key locations to to to Scuttle this transition I think Arab states are very worried about what they're seeing in Damascus today because many of these Arab states you know had invested heavily in the idea of undermining The credibility of political Islam coming to power in an Arab",

                  "content": "make use of Syria as a transit route to resupply hisbah we have millions of refugees around the region who may well be anxious to return home and that process I think holds out a lot of Hope but I suspect that governments in the region will be worried about managing it in a way that that doesn't uh lead to to chaos or instability so we have we have a number of factors we're seeing a really Monumental shift in the geopolitics of the region unfolding in [2390.60s] in front of our eyes and and we'll just have to see how that develops but but my sense is that that there are opportunities here to put the region on a much more stable footing and that'll depend on how Arab regimes neighboring Syria respond to the the current context and N why don't you jump in on that same question about are we a step closer to to more stability in a region that hasn't seen a lot of that recently yeah it remains to be seen I I I share um the Brad outlines that Steven [2422.44s] has just suggested there's always spoilers in a moment like this so I'm very very worried about groups like Isis who want to cause chaos you know exploding bombs and key locations to to to Scuttle this transition I think Arab states are very worried about what they're seeing in Damascus today because many of these Arab states you know had invested heavily in the idea of undermining The credibility of political Islam coming to power in an Arab capital and toppling a dictator especially [2453.72s] through armed Rebellion so many of these Arab states must be very nervous about what they're seeing uh in Syria today and and and watching how this unfolds so um I'm cautiously optimistic but there's going to be huge challenges largely because Syria has a lot of borders porest borders and troublemakers can infl infiltrate those borders to cause chaos so something to watch for um but I don't think it's going to be an easy ride you know uh transitioning from you know this Legacy of 54 years of um you [2484.36s] know one family rule to to a better political order can I follow on to that very quickly I know time is short what Arab regimes wanted from the Assad regime was the stability that would permit the return of refugees weakening of Iran's influence in Damascus and an end to the narcotic smuggling that was a huge source of Revenue to the regime they weren't making much progress with Assad in achieving those aims I suspect they now see that their possibilities for achieving those aims have have increased with the arrival of a new [2515.08s] government and so you know yes Arab regimes invested in the Assad uh dictatorship but that doesn't mean that they can't pivot and adapt to new circumstances ner hashimi and Stephen heiderman thank you very much thank you coming up a flight like no other aimed at creating Christmas Memories we do really give them this experience to think that they're you know actually flying to the North Pole that trip in Santa's big arrival is next in Our [2546.80s] Moment [Music] this is one of 65 kids boarding a very special flight its destination the North Pole for a meeting with Santa once on the plane the crew simulated the trip as the guest of honor was brought in to greet the children and tonight that special moment for those children is Our Moment who was excited to go to the North Pole we have spent the last 3 months identifying families in the community [2577.24s] that have children that are either terally ill or they have catastrophic medical conditions that we wanted to uplift their holidays it really is a special day that provides a lot of Hope and happiness for these families we do really give them this experience to think that they're you know actually flying to the North Pole so when they arrive they get a passport and we have special security lines that are designated for them our captain is Captain cringle the children are are [2608.20s] ecstatic so once the plane lands and we form a line and people are clapping and singing We have Santa that arrived with secret service and each child gets about five or six gifts each so it was just very heartwarming and very heartfelt that we could provide such a great day for these families there's so much that it's so sweet and thoughtful about that including including the brothers and sisters of the kids who are kind of the [2638.52s] focus of each of those trips just because sometimes those brothers and sisters according to organizers feel like they are left out thank you for being with us you can watch anywhere anytime on the free CBC News app And subscribe to the Nationals YouTube channel I'm mean Hannah maning in Vancouver good night",

here tomorrow night law enforcement set to share this hour if they believe they track down a CEO killer we are live in Pennsylvania tonight plus acquitted in New York the Daniel Penny decision turns political and is there New Hope for American hostages believed to be aive live in the [30.72s] Middle East that's topping the hill on news Nation [Music] [Applause] [Music] tonight it was crucial that we were able to remove him off the streets of America and we were going to seek him out no matter no matter where he was at the time earlier this morning in Altuna Pennsylvania members of the Altuna [61.64s] Police Department arrested Luigi mangion a 26-year-old male on Firearms charges at this time he is believed to be our person of interest in the Brazen targeted murder of Brian Thompson CEO of United healthc Care last Wednesday in Midtown Manhattan so did The Manhunt end with an Ivy League graduate and an astute employee at McDonald's tonight New York police believe they have a quote unquote strong person of interest [92.00s] in the shooting death of Brian Thompson the former CEO of United Healthcare hello good evening welcome to Washington I'm Blake Burman this is the hill on news Nation a live look right now in holidaysburg Pennsylvania that's about a 100 miles to to the east of Pittsburgh as later this hour law enforcement officials expect to give the very latest on the five-day Manhunt that started on the streets of New York City and led them to one of America's most famous restaurants about 300 miles away it also comes as a jury rendered a high-profile [123.12s] decision in a different New York case Daniel peny acquitted today by a Manhattan jury and tonight one New York lawmaker is calling for the high-profile district attorney Alvin Bragg to step aside joining me tonight as we await the news out of PA and the Big Apple Chris Wecker former assistant director of the FBI Jennifer coffindaffer and Jesse Weber are both news Nation contributors but we what we begin tonight with what led to law enforcement to this moment and our Caitlyn Becker once again on the streets of New York [155.52s] Caitlyn well Blake it really comes down to all of these surveillance cameras around New York City they were really crucial in this case now for days we have been seeing that one image of The Suspect with his mask pulled down it was taken at a hostel where he was staying here on the upper west side that's where I'm at right now and it was that image that tipped off someone at McDonald's and McDonald's employee to look at someone who was eating breakfast and then turned around and called cops saying to them I think this might be [187.12s] your guy and this is something that NYPD credited to have a huge impact Blake on uh the turning point of this case it was really a question of if you see something say something so the fact that the media got this picture out countless times in the past couple of days and the fact that the NYPD used all of these surveillance cameras to track him down LED to this moment had they not done that I don't know how long this person would have allegedly been you know in the wind we went this morning from them [217.48s] search from scuba divers searching behind me here in Central Park for the alleged murder weapon to authorities believing that they have it they believe that the weapon the suspect was arrested with today may have been the weapon used to Gun Down Brian Thompson last week it is being described as a ghost gun Blake which they think might have been 3D printed so it doesn't have serial numbers on it that is the gun that he was allegedly found with today those are the weapons charges that he will be arraigned on in Pennsylvania shortly he [248.32s] will then be extradited from Pennsylvania back to New York to likely face charges for Thompson's murder but there are a couple other really crucial pieces of evidence that he was allegedly found with as well today a three-page Manifesto um pointing to a potential motive as well as a mask that looked very similar to The Mask the killer was wearing at the time of the murder that we've seen from those surveillance photos and an ID a fake New Jersey ID the same one police say the alleged killer used to check into that hostel [278.84s] here on the upper west side Blake this evening Caitlyn thank you joining me now as I mentioned Jennifer coffindaffer news Nation Law And Justice contributor retired FBI special agent Christopher scker who is uh he's a former FBI assistant director and our Jesse Weber news Nation legal contributor with me as well hello to you all thanks for being here Jennifer it seems like they're trying to walk a walk a fine line here saying this is a a person of interest but not yet saying this is the guy when do you think they get [309.36s] there oh I think they're there I think they're just being politically correct not saying they're there calling him a of Interest Chris what about um you know this obviously LED across several States New York into Pennsylvania perhaps into Georgia at some point we know that there was an investigation down there as well the FBI's role in all of this leading up to this and going forward is what yeah there's an interstate nature to this so now there's a federal Nexus [340.04s] and that we have uh the we have statutes that apply when someone travels Interstate to commit a murder they'll be involved in the they could file charges in federal court so that's that's hanging over it there's also the distinct possibility that if this was ideologically driven for example as Anarchist uh ideology or anti- capitalist anti-corporate ideology then they might fall into the rubric of domestic terrorism which would even more invoke the federal jurisdiction Jennifer [371.64s] be see how this plays out I'm sorry blade you're there as well I saw you nodding along when when Chris threw out the possibility oh absolutely he States it perfectly that's why the bureau is involved and they're involved early on is a police cooperation matter because they don't have jurisdiction meaning nybd the minute they learned that the bus left from Atlanta so of course you're going to get the bureau involved plus they have so many resources concerning digital analysis and other laboratory and resources that [402.80s] they can lend to these types of cases let me bring in Jesse Weber news Nation legal contributor Jesse there's going to be an arraignment here at the bottom of the hour obviously right now there's the the gun charges and this ghost gun what what sort of walk me through what you expect to happen later this evening and in the upcoming days okay so the arraignment will just be his charges will be read to him he'll understand what his rights are these are placeholder charges this is not really what we're concerned about what we are concerned about is what the conversation with New York investigators are going to be having with him because a they want to understand if he really is the person [433.24s] really is the suspect and B what evidence can they present to a grand jury in New York that's key because they need to bring him up on murder charges if in fact he is the suspect and the person who killed Brian Thompson and then of course he'll be extradited back to New York to face those charges I think right now these are charges that you put in place in Pennsylvania to hold him otherwise if they arrested him and they didn't have anything to charge him with he could technically be released but the fact that he was in possession or allegedly in possession of this ghost gun with a silencer that triggers a number of different statutes that could be he can be in violation of in [463.40s] Pennsylvania but really at the end of the day it's New York where we need to focus Chris if you got a phone call I mean that Brian Thompson was the CEO of United Healthcare it was at the time it's the 14th 15th biggest company in the United States of America this is a company with the market cap north of half a trillion dollars and I got to imagine Chris that there are some CEOs tonight of some high-profile companies over the last handful of days that start to wonder what if and if you were picking up the phone and and giving the [496.28s] advice of some concerned companies or individuals what do you tell them yeah in fact I have picked up the phone over the last couple days there is some angst out there this is typical with security it's it's uh they always have their hair on fire and they want they go looking for security when something bad happens my advice is you have to you have to do threat analysis and and decide corporate Executives don't like uh corporate security they don't like executive protection they like to be approachable at the same token they they recognize the need for [526.32s] it sometimes the boards require it so in this case this was a well-published stock you know stockholders meeting uh conference this wasn't a big trade association meeting where it was random you know random people attending they knew the CEOs were going to be attending the high level officers were were going to be attending in a time when there was pretty bad blood in the air if you will that happened back during the financial crisis and there we we uh we had a lot of incidents that were prevented that that could have been one of these types [556.52s] of incidents because we did good threat analysis and we Ed pretty thorough executive protection techniques this case he needed executive protection no doubt about it what's Jennifer I I'll leave the same question to you if if if you're getting those calls what are you what are you telling these individuals absolutely",

what's Jennifer I I'll leave the same question to you if if if you're getting those calls what are you what are you telling these individuals absolutely I I reached out also and was reached out too because the bottom line is many of these CEOs they have in-house protection details but they don't like to use them they like to go down the street uh without a detection or [587.68s] protection detail around them and they've just got to change that because there may be other mangi mangioni so it's just ridiculous for them not to have their protection Jennifer coffin Deer uh Chris scker I got to leave it there with you thank you both for your time I appreciate you being with us here on the hill tonight appreciate it thank you you got it all right meantime elsewhere in New York this evening Daniel penny is walking as a free man tonight a Manhattan jury unanimously finding Penny not guilty of criminally negligent homicide in the New York City [619.04s] Chokehold Subway death case now the courtroom erupting into Applause as the verdict was read aloud a smile leave invisible on Penny's face after leaving Court Penny see celebrating and cracking a cold one with his legal team the New York city mayor Eric Adams commented on the verdict saying he respects the process Jordan should not have had had to die um and I strongly believe as I've been stating probably from day one uh we [649.08s] have a mental health system that is broken a jury of his peers heard the case saw all the facts and all the evidence and made a decision and I joined da Braggs and stating that I respect the process there's been some reaction pouring in from Capitol Hill as well for example the top Republican in Washington right now the house Speaker Mike Johnson calling penny a hero adding in part quote freedom for Daniel Penny great news for Daniel and America he's a hero who saved lives that trial should have never happened in the first place [680.20s] says the speaker of the house now in 2023 Jordan Ney entered a New York City's Subway and began acting erratically yelling about being hungry and thirsty and even saying he was ready to die penny a passenger on the subway grabbed Neely from behind in a choke hold forcing him to the floor after Letting Go Neely was no longer responsive and later declared dead the decision comes 3 days after the manslaughter charge in the second degree was dismissed on Friday after the jury was deadlocked Jesse Weber come on back in uh joining me as well Scott Balden [711.48s] news Nation contributor Scott you saw the reaction there um from the Speaker of the House there has been similar here in in Washington on that side of the aisle as well your reaction today Scott to to the decision from the jury yeah this was a weird uh case in the sense of how it was handled you know both the uh criminal negligence uh homicide as well as a second-degree manslaughter uh both had recklessness as [742.88s] a standard and the first one uh that was uh that the government withdrew um that was a hung jury if you will and then the second one still had recklessness as a as a as an element and then they found it not guilty and that was a lesser included not clear why or what was on the mind of the jurors cuz at least one person held out on the on the serious charge and the less serious charge they all agreed that uh not guilty verdict so very difficult remember you still had somebody that died you had a bad alleged bad actor if [775.28s] you will that's nothing to celebrate if you're the speaker of the house or even if you are the defendant in the casee because in my opinion and it'd be interesting what Jesse says when you have a dead person and you have an alleged bad actor and you have the video regardless of what really caused the death you got to do something about it as a state's attorney I'm a former New York State prosecutor and I got to tell you this is a case that had to be brought this was Justice and we have to respect the verdict of the people je Jesse you you were sort of a gassed on Friday at the way the judge acted then [807.56s] um the decision comes to comes today and your overall Takeaway on this case is so first of all Scott's right look I mean someone died H there was some really compelling facts for the prosecution the fact that Jordan neilly was unarmed he didn't touch anybody look there's only one person to blame there only one set of people it's the prosecutors why if they really believed that he was guilty of manslaughter then when the jury came back on Friday and say we're hung that should have been a mistrial they retry him the fact that by the way this jury was told they can only consider the Lesser charge if they are unanimous [838.32s] about manslaughter and then all of a sudden the prosecutors come forward and say you know what let's throw that out throw it out we're going to dismiss the charge after all this time and now we want to essentially get Daniel Penny Any Which Way can get him you don't think that that had an effect on this jury today you don't think they were frustrated by that you don't think they looked at that and said does the prosecutors even have faith in their own case they're telling us to abandon manslaughter after we just deliberated for over 20 hours trying to figure that out I think that was the difference all right got to leave it there Scott Balden see you later in the show Jesse Weber thank you sir appreciate it you got it [868.56s] all right still come here on the Hill Morgan orus joins us on the other side of the break some of Donald Trump's top National Security picks up on Capitol Hill today and this the backdrop in parts of the Middle East Morgan on what she's hearing and what she believes comes next plus the first lady spotted sitting next to Donald Trump in France can you believe that the president of the United States didn't go and sent his wife in that position instead for that conversation there why is why is that [900.64s] and Juan soda just got the biggest contract in all of sports we break down what that means in Washington terms I'm Blake Burman welcome to Washington this is the hill on news nation and this is the center of politics we're back in four new nation president-elect Donald Trump's National Security nominees up on Capitol Hill today Pete hegseth cash Patel Tulsa gabard perhaps the next [932.96s] leaders of the Pentagon FBI and National Intelligence seen as you can see there coming and going into meetings with Republican Senators throughout the day now their visits also come amid huge developments in the Middle East over the weekend Syrian rebels seized control of the Capitol Damascus forcing the dictator there Bashar al-assad to flee to Russia where he was granted Asylum joining me now Morgan Ortegas former State Department spokesperson in the Trump Administration hello Morgan thanks for being with us always great to see you um I I guess the first question [963.20s] really is is the obvious two-parter which is what do you think happens here in the next 42 days with President Biden as the commander-in-chief and then what do you think happens after that with Donald Trump as the commander-in-chief yeah I mean listen the events of the last two weeks have just been mind-blowing I've spent a lot of my career in the Middle East I was actually living in Sai in 2010 and 11 tried to get to Syria when the Arab Spring Arab Spring first started uh and wasn't was unable to get there so this has been going I've been following this for you know almost uh well over a [994.96s] decade at this point 12 or 13 years now so uh what happened in the last two weeks seems surprising to a lot of people I don't think it's so surprising if you've been following events on the grounds in the past few months because what we're seeing is that Iran's Empire their Spear of influence throughout the Middle East is crumbling and it's not crumbling in my opinion due to the Biden Administration as much as Biden tried to take a Victory lap on that yesterday it's instead crumbling because Israel has exposed Iran uh for the weak regime [1025.04s] I think that they really are they've been great at funding Terror proxies they've been great at trying to wreck havoc throughout the Middle East uh but the core of uh of their control in both Lebanon and Gaza even in Yemen with the houthis and now we're seeing in Syria uh with",

                  "content": "what do you think happens here in the next 42 days with President Biden as the commander-in-chief and then what do you think happens after that with Donald Trump as the commander-in-chief yeah I mean listen the events of the last two weeks have just been mind-blowing I've spent a lot of my career in the Middle East I was actually living in Sai in 2010 and 11 tried to get to Syria when the Arab Spring Arab Spring first started uh and wasn't was unable to get there so this has been going I've been following this for you know almost uh well over a [994.96s] decade at this point 12 or 13 years now so uh what happened in the last two weeks seems surprising to a lot of people I don't think it's so surprising if you've been following events on the grounds in the past few months because what we're seeing is that Iran's Empire their Spear of influence throughout the Middle East is crumbling and it's not crumbling in my opinion due to the Biden Administration as much as Biden tried to take a Victory lap on that yesterday it's instead crumbling because Israel has exposed Iran uh for the weak regime [1025.04s] I think that they really are they've been great at funding Terror proxies they've been great at trying to wreck havoc throughout the Middle East uh but the core of uh of their control in both Lebanon and Gaza even in Yemen with the houthis and now we're seeing in Syria uh with the Assad regime uh the that core of their empire has fallen do you think that's why there's some renewed hope today that maybe Hamas might release the American hostages I think I mean listen I'm not saying this to be partisan I think there's renewed Hope on this because [1055.96s] Donald Trump has threatened Hamas uh not only recently with his statement last week but also remember at the Republican convention whenever President Biden was still the nominee at that point at the Republican convention in his speech that night uh president Trump made it very clear uh that he wanted the hostages returned you know this is something that he placed an enormous amount of emphasis on in our first administration at the time time he was able to get more American hostages back around the world than any president in modern history uh it's really important to him that [1086.32s] Americans come home and he's issued this warning to Hamas so yes I think a week in Iran helps us get to a deal I also think president Trump's threats also help get us to a deal uh in Syria Morgan there is renewed hope possibly of the safe return of Austin TI 43 years old from Texas a journalist who was kidnapped 12 years go on August 13th 2012 President Biden was asked about this yesterday here's what the president said I want to get your reaction on the other [1117.12s] side what does the us know about where Austin P might be in if he safe we believe he's alive we think we can get him back but we have no direct evence to that yet we believe he is alive we think we can get him back but we have no direct evidence of that yet Morgan tapping into into your your knowledge of the region and your state department experience what do you hear there when you hear the commander-in-chief say that well I issued a lot of statements [1148.24s] on Austin Ty we were constantly speaking to his family um I was surprised a little that he said uh that he made the statement not because I have inside knowledge about Austin Ty's whereabouts but just because the families of these hostages hold on to all sense of hope everything that they can get and so you know we're always as government official careful about what we say because you don't want to overpromise and then you know have the family be crushed but I hope President Biden is right and I hope that we can do something about it I think you'll have bipartisan consensus [1179.52s] to want to get him home Morgan Ortegas former State Department spokesperson thanks for being back with us here on the hill talk again soon Morgan appreciate it thanks Blake you got it all right still much more ahead here on the hill tonight live look in PA as police are about to give an update after they arrested what they're describing as a person of interest in the shooting death of the United Healthcare CEO that that press conference from police expected to happen later this hour and when that happens we'll take you there [1215.87s] [Applause] [Music] live all right welcome back here to the hill on news nation is it is nearly the bottom of the hour about 6:29 here on the east coast and any moment now we are

Brian Thompson when that press conference happens we will take you [1246.12s] there live meantime Laura Trump is talking and polarization is popular we'll explain here or Kelly Meyer is here with at and more and what's happening in the capital hello hey there Blake it's good to be back good to be back with you and we start the week taking a look at the ever shifting politics across the Sunshine State Laura Trump officially announced she is stepping down as the co-chair of the Republican National Committee this comes as she weighs her political future ahead of her father-in-law President elect [1277.00s] Donald Trump's return to the White House and there are reports she could replace Marco Rubio and take over his vacant Florida senate seat if he is confirmed to the be the next secretary of state and if confirmed Med Florida Governor Ronda santis will assign Rubio's replacement to serve for two years until the next election in 2026 the FBI and state officials are investigating even more mysterious drone sightings reported in New Jersey and now Philadelphia 19 elected officials are requesting additional assistance from law [1308.32s] enforcement agencies the FAA and the Department of Homeland Security and the New Jersey State Police saying those agencies have taken quote a reactive instead of a proactive approach to this issue those drones were first cited just before Thanksgiving some were even caught flying close to Donald Trump's golf course in Bedminster and Mariam Webster is out with their 2024 word of the year and it stems from this year's presidential election and that word Blake is polarization in an AP interview [1338.76s] Mariam Webster's editor at large said quote polarization means division but it's a very specific kind of division polarization means that we are tending toward the extremes rather than toward the center Mariam Webster logs nearly 100 million page views a month on its website and chooses the word Based on data and search volume the word polarization was widely used across this year's media landscape last year's pick Blake was authentic that's what's happening in the capital 100 million a month yeah that's a that's a a billy a [1371.16s] year give or take you were just down under vacationing I was you were in Australia were they talking about the election there what was your takeaway you know immediately when noticed my accent first they thought I was from Canada so I had to say I was from the US but then they asked you're Kelly from PA that's who you are exactly I had to correct him but he did say how did he said quote how did you guys elect Trump uh and I just said you know he has a lot of support in the United States and it showed in that election were they paying attention yes big time absolutely absolutely yeah Kelly in the capital is back welcome back Meer thank you appr it to see soon later in the show uh all [1402.88s] right so who is on first Republicans aren't exactly at that point of the skit yet but they are just a month away from the from actual governing and how to prioritize among the questions the Cadence of how Republicans will try to carry out Donald Trump's agenda immigration energy and extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts but that is not the only item lawmakers need to figure out nearly a month ago President Biden asked Congress for $100 billion in disaster relief funds to help those recovering [1433.48s] from hurricanes Milton and Helen now it has been 73 days since Helen devastated North Carolina winter is here for many residents still picking up the pieces and will continue for months and years to come now the house has 10 days left in its session the Senate 11 joining me now as the Republican congressman from North Carolina Greg Murphy back here on the hill Congressman thanks for being with us um I I should should note you off the top here if that press [1463.56s] conference in Pennsylvania happens we're going to jump to it um but thanks for being with us of course so you sent out a letter to your to your constituents and I and I read it it recently said the priority in Washington is to ensure our neighbors receive the federal assistance that they need it was four weeks ago November 18th that the White House said $98 billion is what we need and here we are and it hasn't come why uh Blake I I think a lot of the things that were sent down by Biden's administration had a lot [1496.20s] of things in there that should not be in for disaster relief and that's given some individuals a fair amount of and I think deservedly so a heartburn the North Carolina state general assembly passed a bill for uh disaster relief sent it to uh Governor Cooper he vetoed it they're trying to override The veto this needs to be not only a federal response but also a state response that said there have been a lot of things with FEMA they apologized last week because they basically weren't truthful about the number of trailers being sent [1527.44s] uh to Western North North Carolina but this is something",

here on the hill Congressman thanks for being with us um I I should should note you off the top here if that press [1463.56s] conference in Pennsylvania happens we're going to jump to it um but thanks

[1527.44s] uh to Western North North Carolina but this is something that there is Extreme urgency uh to to be dealt with I mean temperatures are plummeting up there in the in the mountains and we need to get this done we don't need people blocking it we need to take out some things that don't need to be there but we need to get this done in DC I hear you I hear you about heartburn I was on the local Asheville paper the citizen times today here's the headline Congressman it says thousands of private Bridges were damaged during Helen nonprofits are helping to rebuild that [1558.44s] says that there were 7,000 reports of damage to private roads and bridges in Western North Carolina 27700 households um have received some funding 8.2 million the more applications are pending there are some Republicans in the House Freedom caucus who are holding this up you talk about the heartburn Andy Harris is the Republican head of the freedom caucus as you know there was the Key Bridge in Maryland which went down and he gave an interview uh Congressman in which he said will it all get done talking about [1590.08s] Key Bridge funding will it all get done the entire 2 billion I'm not sure but I'm pretty sure we can make a down payment and here's why I bring that up Congressman because it seems like there's some who are saying when there's tragedy in my backyard I'm good with spending when there's tragedy not in my backyard heartburn as you put it and it sounds hypocritical well it's nonsense to do this we are a nation that's why we have States that's why we have a federal government to help in times of need in [1620.92s] different states be there wildfires out in the west um tragic uh you know hurricanes that happen on the coast or ones that hell go up the Ohio Valley like this is this is a time actually that we need to come together as government that said you know I don't think wish list or Parks or somewhere else um as far as disaster relief needs to occur but that but but we need to get moving with this there's enough of the obstructionism there's enough of the hey it's not 100% perfect not going to vote for that kind of Bill we've seen that way too many times especially in the [1652.92s] last two years here um it's time for people to understand that we're here as a federal government to help people in times of need but what has happened in Western North Carolina is biblical um it's sad it's been there I've been out there we need to help those individuals need to help help them yesterday get through the nonsense sent in by the Biden Administration but we also need to get our state and our federal Partners working yesterday to make sure that the folks get relief that they deserve Congressman Greg Murphy a republican from the eastern part of the Tar Hill [1682.96s] State got to leave it there on a busy news night thank you sir for being back with us here on the hill thank care Blake thank you got look at his head of hair he's got no hair problem I want to tell you that look at that hair huh we're here we love you all thank you all right so that of course was uh Donald Trump introducing the baseball star Juan stto at the White House in 2019 as a member of the world's champion Washington Nationals and 5 years later stto just hit his net worth out of the park agreeing to the biggest contract [1714.00s] ever in sports history 765 million over 15 years to play for the New York Mets now put that salary in perspective here on the hill it is roughly equivalent to the salary of one senator for 4,300 years 88 years for all US senators 1300 years for one Senator and one president and the pay of every member of Congress for the past nine years years all right unless you get that lucky lotto ticket that 3/4 of a billion is probably never coming your way but here's something [1745.32s] that might impact your bank account next year president-elect Trump over the weekend claiming that he won't try to get rid of Jay Powell the chairman of the Federal Reserve will you try to replace Jerome poell no I don't think so I don't see it but uh I don't I think if I told him to he would but uh if I asked him to he probably wouldn't but if I told him to he would you don't have plans to do that right now no I don't Powell's term ends in May of 2026 but there have been questions regarding if Trump can and [1775.84s] whatever try to get rid of him before them now the FED helps determine interest rates and if you have a loan you can in part thank the FED for playing a role in that rate here to break it down with me Mick Mulaney former Trump white house chief of staff news Nation contributor you ran the budget uh for a little while head of the cfpb you know the thing about Finance thing or two about finances how you doing doing good by the way I was watching that thing about Juan stto and it reminds me of a a piece of American History I'm going to butcher from the 1920s when uh Babe Ruth was making more [1807.60s] than the president of the United States and the Press asked him you know remember what his answer was uh more important or something I had a better year better year there you go all right let let me show you um why we're talking about J Powell and what this all means for your finances so this is the Dot Plot okay very wonky but here's what I want you to pay attention to 2024 this is the Fed rate right now at about 4.2% 2025 they are expecting it to tick down about a percent lower to 32% 2026 when [1838.16s] the president in theory will have a new fed share in there even lower than that now um Mick hold that thought for a second because as you know rates don't necessarily go hand inand with everyday items but this is sort of the impact of how it could impact you because the average mortgage right now somewhere in the area of about 6 and 3/4% something like that an average car loan is in the high eights right now so as these numbers tick down uh that's sort of what it means for your house for your here [1868.68s] you go for your house for your mortgage Etc were you shocked by that comment from Trump um a little bit I I I I think that the legal team has has come to the conclusion the Trump legal team has come to the conclusion that they have the ability to replace him as the chairman they don't have the ability to kick him off of the the board and that's an interesting distinction because he's the he's sort of the chairman of the board and I think if things got really bad they might try that first say Jay we need you to step back from chairman should be still going to be in the board [1898.84s] but again I think a lot of this has to do with the way the economy shakes out the next couple of months um put that Dot Plot up real quick because I want I want to ask Mick for a second because Donald Trump wants rates low he wants them down here not up here right so when he eventually has a Fed pick what do you think he does and do you think there's going to be a for lack of a better term a mandate to bring it down here you know hard to say this a mandate um because if you do this too early if you set rates down here the reason rates are here is in order to try and dampen inflation [1929.24s] okay so if we had rates down here when inflation was was was was boiling over it would have gotten even worse right so when you're Donald Trump yeah you do like low rates because it makes it easy to borrow money and easy to do business um but you don't like high inflation because that really tends to sort of ruin your brand long term and the Legacy you have as president so it's a balancing act um and my guess is they're going to have some really interesting conversations in the westwing over the course of the next four years about the interplay between interest rates and don't forget the value of the",

want to invest in dollars so the demand for dollars goes up uh Trump is going to want interest rates down here because it also lowers the value of the dollar Mick Mulaney former Trump white house chief of staff really interesting conversations he says speaking of them other side of the break full Pano I'm here you're going to hang around live look from PA by by the way police about to give an update after they arrested a quote unquote person of interest in the shooting death of the UHC CEO when that happens we'll take you there [1991.32s] live news Nation tonight the battle lines are drawn as Pete heg fights to remain president Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon will the nomination survive the Senate heth's attorney joined Dan Abrams live tonight only on news Nation news Nation Al live look once again holidaysburg Pennsylvania authorities there expected to give an update on the uh arrest earlier today related to the uh shooting of the United Healthcare CEO when that happens we will take you there [2023.96s] live meantime it's been a busy few weeks for the first lady Jill Biden first her husbands gave their son Hunter Biden a blanket pardon that extended for for nearly a decade the president left the country afterwards and the very next day it was the first lady who had to answer questions about the pardon then the president um had the first lady attend in Paris for the reopening of the notredam cathedral as world leaders descended on the City of Lights including president- elect Trump on top of all this Trump posted an image of him and the first lady at the [2055.92s] reopening to promote his fragrance line captioning the image of fragrance your enemies can't resist joining me now a laughing Mick mulany former Chief of Staff in the Trump Administration Julia Manchester National political reporter forth hill.com Kelly Meer newsnation Washington correspondent and Dan canon in Battleground States director for the Biden Harris campaign hello to you all the only one laughing at that come on I was you were here's the here's the thing he goes the president goes to Africa and Joe Biden has to answer for the pardon then she goes to uh Paris and has [2090.48s] to sit five feet next to Donald Trump and I'm thinking Dan come on this this keeps getting sent to the spouse and not to him they didn't send her out to the podium in in the pool to be clear right it was a holiday party event where a question was question yes and the president is being the president both in Africa and and the US in Washington where he was managing the US's response to the Assad regime toppling in Syria and doing that work of ensuring that we make sure our our our military is poised to ensure Isis does not take hold again in Syria that serious work Donald Trump [2122.52s] at Notre Dame at a grand opening of a church selling fragrances is not being President Joe Biden is still being president is he on to something there or is is this a bad look I'm going to try and take politics out of it and just say look at the way the world looks at it right I'm not I I don't dislike Trump I don't like Trump I'm just somebody looking at from the outside Donald Trump's already the president um it's a unique situation because he's an ex-president coming back everybody knows he's coming back they know who he is he's one of the most well-known people in the world I think at least from a foreign policy perspective he is already [2153.84s] the president of the United States yes there's 42 days and yes we're hearing stories about the Democrat hurrying to finish projects get money out the door and all of that but de facto Donald Trump is already the president of the United States like I was saying to you Blake I I was speaking with reporters in France and they were asking where's your president and I said which one because you had president-elect Trump there you had the current president that we thought maybe would be going there but it was the first lady instead um and I think it's just interesting to see you know pres former president and now president-elect Trump on the world stage and a source said to me today as we were doing this story on news Nation saying [2185.28s] that they are letting Democrats are pissed said that they are letting uh Trump essentially become president two months early okay so to be fair we have seen the White House send for the first lady in the Biden Administration to other foreign events she was at the coronation of King Charles we see it with other spouses so this isn't completely abnormal I think on top of that first lady Jill Biden is very popular I would say she's probably more popular than Joe Biden so I think it would make sense sometimes to put her out sort of optically put a popular [2215.92s] figure out maybe instead of the president who right now quite frankly isn't as popular but to be clear again this is a ceremonial role an event at the at the chapel of Notre Dame at the church with that's what this is what Joe Biden is doing and what he is conditioned to do both this time in the Senate and his president is deal with foreign events and Foreign Affairs and there's a serious thing happening in Syria and there's a serious issue with Russia and with Ukraine and the implications of those countries and Iran and he's focused on that he's not focused on going to a church ceremony you're ABS you're absolutely right on the church ceremony being ceremonial and I get that why not send Harris because [2247.24s] that's typically what we would have done you send the vice president to those things not the first lady without the president would that have made you feel better about his situation no I'm just wondering where Kamal hares is because if if things are are operating properly In The West Wing then the vice president is supposed to go to those things yeah I don't remember ever sending the first lady anywhere to fill in for the president look I'll I'll just say this really quickly when when we were on The Campaign which I was there are many many times that we wanted to deal with campaign business and whether it was the president or the vice president if something was serious was happening in the world our stuff waited until that got dealt with so whether it's a vice president or the president they're going [2278.92s] to focus on those serious businesses abroad and not the ceremonial pieces when that's what that's required I I don't know I see her out there twice next to Trump and then having to sort of answer whether it was fair or not for Hunter and it's just twice in one week and it's an observation I've got I've got a a bigger question the same topic which is is the staff sticking around that that'd be one of my there's only 42 days left they want to try and get stuff done but most most of those people in that building route looking for their [2309.84s] next job are there enough people there Dan to still they are they're committed those people are very committed to finishing the job and making sure as much policy can get done and accomplished in the way for the country as they can give you the last word I was going to say they did just put out a memo from the chief of staff Jeffrey zans to all the staff to say we are not done yet they're trying to go with the Sprint say there's 42 days left so they're going to try to keep this going to make sure that they say they get the job done um there I I told you we've been monitoring developments in Pennsylvania the um the the person of interest quote unquote who was uh picked [2340.04s] up by authorities today Luigi Manion 26-year-old uh 26 years old arraigned on gun charges just a little while ago our Alex caprelo is live in Pennsylvania with the with the very latest there what happened Alex yeah look they just had that preliminary arraignment where they outlin the charges against him he uh Manion I should say appearing in person for this hearing uh this was the very first time we ever actually laid eyes on him in person he was barefoot he was [2370.64s] handcuffed at the",

                  "content": "good morning everyone how are you my name is anit and we will be taking up today's Daily Newspaper analysis today is 7th of December and we have in our today's discussion topics from these three newspaper sources that we cover on a daily basis the Hindu Indian Express as well as the pib website now we'll be [30.20s] starting off our today with the editorial discussion which appeared in the Hindu newspaper it is on the Revival of manufacturing sector now why does manufacturing sector needs Revival in the first place ever thought about that let me tell you why now historically any country if it were to get into a developed Nation category this is called as a structural transformation now India [61.20s] historically has been a agricultural based society where close to 45% of people are involved in manufacturing uh in agricultural based activities so as to absorb the Surplus labor which are which are there in the agricultural sector into manufacturing sector you need to develop manufacturing sector understood so that is why our country needs Revival of manufacturing sector now it is not that India's manufacturing sector has not grown Leaps and Bounds in [93.44s] past few decades it has actually but even then the manufacturing share in country's GDP hovers around 17 to 18% of GDP now this is the reason why we need to revive the manufacturing sector to bring this figure upwards of 25% so this is the reason why it needs Revival now now this article is written by the head of an pressure group called [124.96s] Confederation of Indian industry and it is Rich with examples and facts which we will discuss today now this news article is important from GS paper 3 syllabus because changes in industrial policy is mentioned in the mains examination syllabus in the part of GS3 paper now as I already told you India's manufacturing sector has grown leaps and bowns in last few years primarily due to a scheme called production linked [156.64s] incentive scheme now this production linked incentive scheme has revived India's manufacturing capacity however this article states that despite such measures strong reforms especially by the state governments are needed to fully capitalize India's potential in the manufacturing sector CIA Northern neighbor for example that is China it has also grown quite a large number of economy it has [187.84s] become world's second largest economy and why has it become so because of development of manufacturing sector that China's manufacturing sector is not just able to meet its domestic demand but it is exporting products all over the world including India now because of various conflicts especially the disruption as a result of covid pandemic the world has become aware that dependence only just on China for manufacturing activities not conducive for World economy so they [219.00s] are exploring other options as well which is called as China plus one strategy now according to this strategy companies are exploring other options as well and India is in a prime position to act as a China's replacement in the manufacturing sector but you understand right we need to make conditions conducive to attract foreign investments into India and this is what [249.48s] today's article highlights now first this article states that countries manufacturing sector has witnessed impressive performance and to support its argument the article quotes annual survey of Industries 2022 and 23 results now annual survey of Industries is a survey of Industries as the name highlights it surveys formal manufacturing setup establishments especially the establishments which [280.52s] employ 10 or more people especially if it is a powered industry and more than 20 people especially if it is non-powered industry so this was the reason why you need annual survey of Industries now this survey has highlighted that India's manufacturing sector has registered a growth rate of 21.5% whereas the gross value added of [311.36s] manufacturing has grown by more than 7% now this is last two decades result now especially this uh survey codes the developments related to PL sector now if you recall our discussions day before yesterday I told you PL sector is a scheme by government of India where 14 sectors are eligible such as Auto components drone manufacturing companies [342.12s] Etc and in this 14th sector the government is providing incentives to companies to set up their manufacturing hubs in India now this incentive is provided to the companies on incremental production that is after they've registered to the scheme and have become eligible the increase in their production only on that increase the incentives will be provided now these P sectors have contributed 58% to India's total manufacturing output and [375.48s] has witnessed output growth of 24.5% so you can understand the manufacturing sector as a whole has grown by 21.5 sector and even more than that has grown the pl eligible companies now this was the uh survey that says that India's performance has been impressive but today's article also highlights what measures could further be taken by governments and policy makers in order to make India a [407.48s] manufacturing Hub across the world now first suggestion in this regard has been to extend the pl incentives now currently the pl incentives are available able only to 14 sectors and to companies which are very large so only large companies are eligible that to only in 14 sectors now today's article highlights that first government needs to extend this initiatives or incentives to labor intensive industry now what are [438.36s] labor intensive Industries it is simply those Industries which employ a lot of labor for example textiles a barrels footware Furniture these industries are called labor intensive Industries and we need to provide PL incentives for such Industries as well also it suggests extending of PL incentives to Sunrise [470.36s] sector now Sunrise sector are those sectors whose potential will go on a further times in coming years these are drone manufactur ERS Advanced Computing sectors even solar renewable energy sectors these are Sunrise sectors so we need to extend PL incentives to such sectors as well in order to make India not just manufacturing Hub but also a technological Hub now the second suggestion was reducing the import dependence on sectors now although PL [503.12s] scheme has increased India's manufacturing capabilities but this manufacturing capabilities has also come at a significant cost now what is that cost it is that many Industries they depend on sourcing of raw materials from other countries that are they are dependent on Imports the most prime example is the mobile manufacturing industry now mobile manufacturing requires you to Source processes from [533.24s] taian screens from South Korea as well as other important components such as printed circuits board from countries such as China so all of these countries originally manufactured the raw material which is assembled into India and that is why India's Manufacturing in Mobile uh mobile components is taking place so this although results into increased exports from India but also increased to our Imports so we need to reduce our [564.64s] import dependence of such sectors but you also realize that you cannot just remove Imports you have to reduce them only to a significant aspect so as long as your products remain competitive throughout the world so in case any industry would want Imports in that case the article highlights that you need to streamline India's import regime because currently India's import regime is rather impulsive in nature because uh [598.84s] government due to pressure from domestic Industries what they do is they impose High import tariffs but companies which are importing raw materials they end up paying more tariffs and as a result the cost of manufacturing increases so you need to simplify or streamline the import regime by a simplified tariff system that is a three stage tariff system which will not just make our exports more competitive but will also keep our manufacturing cost low so the [629.44s] idea is to keep the manufacturing cost low and increase the competitiveness of India's exports now the fourth point is that India needs to venture into green manufacturing why green manufacturing because World across there has been a demand of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the manufacturing process and even countries like or [659.76s] European Union that is a major trading block across the world it is imposing sanctions on countries who are not manufacturing or who are not keeping their greenhouse gases emissions flow so we need to venture into green manufacturing as well and also we need to undertake research and development in advanced Manufacturing tech Now by Advanced Manufacturing tech what we mean is it gives away or it produces high quality components which are in high demand in Western and developed Nations [692.12s] and also Advanced manufacturing tax also keeps our cost of manufacturing Low by efficiently using the inputs also this article highlights that currently there exists a regional imbalance in our development because if you see from this map five states that are Maharashtra Karnataka Tamil Nadu Gujarat and utar Pradesh just this five state are responsible for as much as 56% of total [725.72s] Manufacturing in our country and they employ 60% of total manufacturing Workforce so on one hand out of 28 odd States we have five states who are manufacturing more than 50% of our manufacturing capabilities whereas rest of 23 States they are just manufacturing what 44 % and Manufacturing setup in our country is absent in the west eastern part of our country that is these are [757.48s] lesser developed States and they witness low amount of manufacturing activity so our today's article it states that we need Regional balance in development that is people from all across the country they need not migrate into more developed States rather the industries could be set up in their home states which will do away with the need for urban and rurban migration now to undertake Regional balance in development we need the [789.44s] states of Indian Union to implement what are known as factor market reforms now what are factor market reforms these are reforms related to land labor Capital as well as infrastructure now for example if any state is able to provide Industries with low cost of power and facilitates the [821.92s] investment in their capital and also these states can provide these companies land free of cost or at at low cost and also Supply adequate amount of skilled labor which is essential for manufacturing activities so by undertaking factor market reforms many states can",

                  "content": "see from this map five states that are Maharashtra Karnataka Tamil Nadu Gujarat and utar Pradesh just this five state are responsible for as much as 56% of total [725.72s] Manufacturing in our country and they employ 60% of total manufacturing Workforce so on one hand out of 28 odd States we have five states who are manufacturing more than 50% of our

Regional balance in development we need the [789.44s] states of Indian Union to implement what are known as factor market reforms now what are factor market reforms these are reforms related to land labor Capital as well as infrastructure now for example if any state is able to provide Industries with low cost of power and facilitates the [821.92s] investment in their capital and also these states can provide these companies land free of cost or at at low cost and also Supply adequate amount of skilled labor which is essential for manufacturing activities so by undertaking factor market reforms many states can attract many foreign investors which will again enable them to set up manufacturing setups in their very own State and this [852.80s] also has socioeconomic implications that it will reduce migration pressures on urban areas on western parts of the country it will improve the livelihood and local economy of the Lesser developed States and hence it will lead to Social and economic inclusion of our people Additionally the scheme highlights that there is a need to tailor PL incentive schemes to accommodate msmes now why msmes are that important now [886.52s] msmes they are responsible for about 45% of total country's manufacturing levels and they employ almost 6 CR people in undertaking such activities however under current PL regime only large companies are eligible and not small companies are eligible so that is why we need to tailor PL incentives so as to make msmes eligible and by making msmes eligible will also be upgrading [917.16s] their technologies that when they interact with other companies in their competition they will try to compete with them by bringing better technology lower cost and a simplified system so this is what tail tailoring of PL incentive scheme for msme means also today's article highlights that we need to enhance the female Workforce participation rate now in the past 3 or four years of so India has witnessed 10% increase in female labor force [948.80s] participation to say 37% of eligible female Workforce however despite this 10% increase India still Lacks behind other countries for example China has 60% of female labor force participation rate so today's article highlights that if we are able to enhance female Workforce participation in our country it will not just improve the livelihood and lives of female [978.84s] workers but it will also enable India to grow by 7 to 8% more of GDP every year so this does not makes just a social case but it is also an economic case that you can improve our country's growth prospects by allowing or promoting female Workforce participation rate so this is what today's article was all about that what needs to be done in order to make India fully realize its manufacturing [1013.92s] potential now with this we move to Second article of the day which appeared also in the Hindu newspaper on page 12 and it says that the employee Provident fund organization has won a global award that is international Social Securities Association good practice award now for example this practice award is not that much important from our upsc perspective what but what is important is that this [1044.88s] organization abbreviated as epfo now this news article is important from GS paper 3 syllabus so let us see The employe Provident fund organization now this is one of the world's largest social security organization and why am I saying one of the world's largest because it has more than 25 CR member [1076.08s] accounts now it deals with large set of clientele primarily the served section of the society which are under some form of formal service now this body came into existence with the promulgation of the employee Provident fund ordinance in the year 1951 and later on this ordinance was replaced by a statutory act called employee Provident funds Act of the Year 1952 which is now referred to as [1106.84s] employee Provident funds and and miscellaneous Provisions act now this or the Ambit of this act extends to whole of India now this body is managed or administered by a triar board which means this board has representations from three different sections of society and the board is called Central Board of trust trees which consists representatives of government which includes both Central and state [1138.36s] government representatives of employers or the companies as well as the employees or the workforce so these are the three parties of central Board of Trustees and this board administers a contributory Provident fund scheme which is called as EPF scheme now for salaried class certain percentage of their basic income they have to submit to a EPF account and the same amount of contribution will [1168.40s] also be made by the company into your account and the eligible beneficiaries are eligible to get this benefits after their retire from the service now when they get this benefits after they retire from the service it is Exempted from taxation at income Source at interest source as well as when you withdraw the money so it is completely Exempted from any tax obligations however there's also an [1199.28s] option to withdraw your PF savings before you retire however in that case the eligibility from income tax exemption is not provided and this is done so in order to make people more aware that they can withdraw their benefits after the retirement and it act or it will act as a sense of social security for them this board also administers a pension scheme which is pension scheme 1995 and an insurance scheme for the workforce who are engaged in or organized sector called Insurance scheme [1231.40s] of the Year 1976 now this body functions under the noal control of ministry of labor and employment understood so let us now solve the practice question that I have curated and this is based on upsc pattern with reference to employees Provident fund organization consider the following statements now epfo is a statutory body is it a statutory body yes it is because [1263.48s] it has been formed by an act of parliament called employee Provident fund and miscellaneous Provisions act now this body is tasked with managing employee Provident fund scheme as I've already highlighted so this is correct statement the second statement the epfo administers a pension scheme under which employees are entitled to a guaranteed pension post retirement which is again [1295.88s] correct now contributions to the EPF by both employer and employees are tax exempt at all stages now pay close attention to what I'm about to say now there are frequent statements in upsc prelims examination which give a definite or a universal statement that very or all so these statements are example of absolute statements and in many cases they are incorrect but rather than [1327.12s] marking them based on your hunch you need to know the idea behind those statements now what if I told you in this previous slide that if you are withdrawing your PF savings after your retirement then it is completely Exempted from the tax liability but this is not the case when you withdraw it before your retirement so from that logic it is not Exempted from tax at all [1358.08s] stages that it is only Exempted from tax in case you withdraw after retirement and not when you withdraw before retirement so the third statement here is incorrect so which of the statements given above is or are correct the correct answer is option A as one and two are correct and third is not now another article this one is from Indian Express page 12 and this talks about Farmers ID Now farmers ID have been issued to Farmers across the [1390.00s] country and the state of Gujarat has become the first state to hit the mark of 25% of farmers ID now this is an initiative by the government similarly like un and I have Adar card farmers will be provided a farmer ID called upna pan so let us understand what is this farmers's ID it is also known as K kissan panra it is an Adar linked Union digital identity where kissan will have [1420.56s] to seed their Farmers ID with their Adar number now this is done in order to avoid duplication of farmers ID now these IDs they are created and maintained by the state and union governments pay close attention to this and this ID will be linked to various farmer related data what are farmer related data like what kind of land the farmer is cultivating their crops in is it their own land or they are renting it from another source also what is their [1452.60s] livestock ownership livestock ownership determines how farmers are eligible to undertake an income security what if their crops failed so in that case they can rely on livestocks also the ideas of what crops they saw and based on this idea the government will provide them with the benefits and these there are many benefits such as subsidy benefits knowledge support which is provided to Farmers through CSC centers [1486.36s] and krishi Vian kendras now this database which the government will have after the creation of farmers ID will be known as a farmers registry and this farmers regist is a part of a larger schem called Agri stack now",

subsidy benefits knowledge support which is provided to Farmers through CSC centers [1486.36s] and krishi Vian kendras now this database which the government will have after the creation of farmers ID will be known as a farmers registry and this farmers regist is a part of a larger schem called Agri stack now Agri stack is very similar to what un and I know as UPI UPI enables us to transfer money from One bank account into another and it is called a digital public infrastructure that is an infrastructure created by the government [1517.44s] over the digital era and this infrastructure enables us to use it and send money across similarly government is also creating a disal public infrastructure called Agri stack for agricultural sector which has three components that is it will have a farmers registry Geo referenced Village maps as well a as well as a crop own registry so farmers are taken care of here land is taken care of here and crops are taken care of through the use [1549.80s] of digital public infrastructure called Agri stack now this enables effective scheme delivery to Farmers it enables the government to know more about Farmers what are their social economic status and it also helps government assess what kind of crops are grown in the country and does government need to take any step in order to improve the country's food security obligations now there are key targets which can be included but before [1580.72s] that let us know more about Agri stack it consists of farm registry where farmers will be given a digital ID Geo reference Village maps where Farmers ID it will be linked to State government's land records and demographic details family details Etc and a crops own registry where the what are the crops will be recorded based on mobile based service now the government has set a target of issuing 11 CR identities over [1612.28s] next 3 years in a stepbystep manner and it will also launch a distal crop survey Nationwide within 2 years which will cover as many as 400 districts by 2024 25 that is this financial year and all districts by the next financial year now based on this information let us solve this practice question with reference to Farmer ID consider the following statement it is an AAR link [1643.88s] unique digital ID created and maintained by Union government is it a correct statement no why because it is created and maintained by not Union but state governments now the second statement government aims to create a digal identity for 11 CR Farmers by the end of financial year 2026 27 which you can see from here is a correct [1676.24s] statement so as only second statement here is correct that's why option b is the right answer to this practice question now another article in the Indian Express and this article highlights that yesterday RBI did not change the policy rate which is also known as repo rate now repo rate is the rate based on which the banks borrow funds [1706.28s] from RBI on a short-term BAS basis and in exchange of borrowing this funds Bank provides RBI with government securities so this government security RBI holds as a collateral and after the banks return their money they can take away their government securities which have been kept with the RBI as collateral now the implication of this repo rate is that if you reduce the repo rate Banks can borrow money from RBI at a cheaper rate and when Banks can borrow money at a [1737.04s] cheaper rate obvious VI ly they'll be extending loans at a cheaper rates too like to people like you and I so this is the reason why RBI increases or decreases repo rate based on money supply now if Government reduces repo rate that means it will or it wants to increase the levels of money supply in the economy but there is a challenge in increasing money supply that if you increase money supply too much it can [1768.12s] can lead to increased level of inflation in the country now this policy measures taken by RBI to increase or decrease money supply is important from GS paper 3 syllabus now RBI has many obligations towards Indian Society Indian government but it has some special responsibilities and this is called as [1798.60s] a statutory responsibility now RBI Act of the Year 1934 it was amended in the year 2015 and the RBI was given a mandate that is it has to keep the inflation rate at a band of plus 4 plus - 2% which means the inflation levels in the country has to be kept between 2% and 6% of what of [1829.00s] consumer price index and this is the primary responsibility of RBI but RBI also keeps into account lower inflation rate while promoting steady economic growth so these are two-fold objectives however the first objective is to control the levels of inflation between 2 to 6% of the economy [1860.08s] now the body which decides on whether to keep the repor rate changed or unchanged is called as a monetary policy committee or MPC now it is a committee which comes under RBI and it consists of six members which is headed by RBI governor and it also consist of a Deputy Governor of RBI which is who is in charge of monetary policy a member of RBI board nominated by the governor and three members who [1892.00s] are nominated by the central government now this six people decide on whether RBI should increase or decrease the money supply now in case there is a tie of votee the casting vote is given to the head of monetary policy committee that is RBI governor and they decide by majority what to do and what not to do now yesterday's monetary policy decision by 4 to majority decided that they need to keep the repo rate unchanged for the [1924.76s] 11th consecutive time now why is RBI not reducing the repo rate now RBI is not reducing the repo rate because currently the inflation Target is not achieved as per the RBI now how does RBI achieves this inflation Target there are tools at rbi's disposal which are classified as quantitative [1956.88s] tools and qualitative tools now quantitative tools are those tools where RBI can change money supply through many policy decisions such as reducing or increasing repo rate cash Reserve ratio as well as statutory liquidity ratio now whenever you reduce rep rate or CLR or SLR requirements it releases funds into economy which increases money [1987.08s] supply now yesterday although RBI did not change the repo rate they reduced the crr from 4.5% to 4% which you can understand will unlock Extra funds for Bank to lent more now I have covered crr in discussions on 5th of December and you can watch this slide or refer to the video of 5th December for more clarity what crr cut results into and what is the impact of [2017.32s] crr cut now let us discuss what are qualitative tools now these are kind of signals that the RBI gives to the banks that they need to lend more in what direction and how to lend more but these are not obligations on the banks rather quantitative tools are more obligative whereas qualitative tools are rather symbolic in nature now why has RBI not reduced the repo rate and it is because currently India is witnessing persisting [2049.72s] retail inflation retail inflation means inflation of consumer price index now almost 45 to 46% of consumer price index consist of food and fuel items and India is witnessing food inflation due to increase in prices of vegetables and edible oils that is why as RB is not comfortable with the inflation Target that it has not been under control that is why they have not reduced the repo rate Also earlier before President Trump [2083.76s] got into elected into us it was expected that the US Central Bank called as US Federal Reserve will keep on reducing its interest rate however since Trump has returned to power he has said that he'll impose tariffs on Imports from other countries including China and India now if Trump goes ahead by imposing tariffs it will result into increased inflation in the American economy so the American Bank will not go on about its planned rate cuts which it [2113.88s] had planned originally now increased inflation levels or increased rates in American economy means that India cannot decrease its interest rate because in that case if India decreases its interest rate money will flow from India to us because investors are getting better return there so India wants to coordinate its rate cut with that of US Federal bank and US Federal bank has rather decided to go slow on rate Cuts so these are the reasons why RBI has not [2145.60s] made any rate cut this in this policy meeting but RBI Governor yesterday in his press conference also gave the future outlook of India economy that is due to to good amount of sewing in rabby season India will witnessed healthy agricultural outputs in this",

but RBI Governor yesterday in his press conference also gave the future outlook of India economy that is due to to good amount of sewing in rabby season India will witnessed healthy agricultural outputs in this financial year and because of this there will be reduction in retail inflation primarily inflation related to food and vegetable items also the recent important [2176.60s] development that India witnessed Just 4 5.4% growth in the last quarter of this financial year the RBI Governor said that this economic slowdown is transitory in nature and this was because of many reasons that the industry sector primarily the mining sector it was affected due to increased rainfall in this monsoon season and as the cond conditions now have become conducive it will lead to economic recovery and hence this slowdown is [2207.44s] rather transitory in nature okay so this was our today's discussion and let us now solve the prct this question with reference to monetary policy committee consider the following statements now the MPC determines the policy rate required to achieve the growth Target is RBI tracking any growth Target no because RBI rather wants to track an inflation [2237.76s] Target which is 4 + minus 2% of consumer price index so this is what RBI is trying to capture so first statement here is incorrect now MPC it consist of six members three of which are appointed by the central government I've already highlighted this is a correct statement because MPC has one who is RBI governor who acts as a [2268.28s] head of this monetary policy committee plus two members from RBI which is one Deputy Governor and one member appointed Ed by the governor as well as three members who are appointed by the union government so the second statement here is a correct statement now the third statement MPC is required to meet at least once in 2 months now I've taken the statement [2298.60s] because in practice the RBI monetary policy committee meets every 2 months but this is by convention rather in law it is required that RBI should meet or monetary policy should meet at least four times in a year however RBI can meet any time if it feels so in order to change or alter the policy rates so second statement here is incorrect if it were to say that RBI is required to meet at least four times in a year then it [2329.64s] would have been correct so as only second statement for second statement here is correct option A is the right answer because the question asks us to identify how many statement are incorrect sorry so the correct statement here is option b because first and third statement are incorrect okay now we move to another article again from the editorial section of Indian Express and this article has been [2360.16s] written by the country's Health Minister Mr JP NADA and in this article he's highlighting that the government is launching a 100 day campaign to show up a battle against a disease called tuberculosis now this news article is important from GS paper 3 syllabus because this syllabus deal with social sector and emphasizes on health sector so we'll be taking up this [2391.36s] article now the disease called tuberculosis it is a bacterial disease now this bacterial disease happens because of a bacteria called Micco bacterium tuberculosis and it is a disease which affects a person's lung now this inhibits our breathing capabilities and that is why the symptoms of TB are most visible by coughing and sne of an individual who is down with TB now this TB disease is has [2426.28s] impacted India so Society significantly because many people first of all they do not know that they are suffering from TB and that is why they are unable or not willing to get treated and that is why this disease burden has been persisting for some time now any person who is been suffering from TB will not be able to explore its full economic potential that they'll not be able to study they'll not be able to go to work and this affects not just them but their entire families and also there's a huge [2459.08s] cost of expenditure which people incur on getting themselves treated with TB so in that regards the government has been on a mission mode for past few years to eradicate and eliminate TB altogether from India's society and in this regard today's article highlights that from pioneering research of Advanced Diagnostic and treatments and introduction of a universal social support Provisions India is at the Forefront of global TB [2490.20s] response now first let us understand what are the measures taken by the government to control TB first is a support scheme which is called Nik portion yoga where earlier it was 500 rupees that was given now it has been doubled to rupees 1,000 and this money sent directly into the bank accounts of 1.16 CR beneficiaries and this money is intended to give them nutrition which is [2521.28s] necessary to fight TB also the government is looking to enhance the levels of community mobilization that not just people who are suffering from TV should be aware but the entire Society should be aware and based on this awareness mass movement is taking place to increase awareness and provide nutritional vocational as well as psychological support to TB patients now due to this mass movement as many as 1.7 lakh Nika mitras will provide 21 lakh [2556.28s] food baskets to patients across the country so you understand first of all government is sending them money and also government is enhancing the mobilization of the community to provide support to TB patients by providing them with food baskets also India in order to treat the TB patients have introduced newer drugs such as bacin as well as delamanid which will improve the treatment success rates in India now there are different types [2588.36s] of regime or the treatment regime which the people can take and for people who want to get treated quickly the government has introduced a new shorter regime called BPM which is more effective than the existing regime now the existing regime were of two types first one was a shorter treatment which took 9 to 11 months and the another one was a longer 19 to 20 month treatment regime so the government has introduced a newer regime which aims to treat or complete the [2620.12s] treatment in just 6 months so saving this precious time of the patient also I've already highlighted that the more problem with TB is the detection of TB so their government has set up molecular test which are a efficient and accurate diagnostic tool and this is intended and the capacity of these tests have increased from few 2014 15 and now today every District in our country has as much as [2652.60s] 8,300 molecular diagnostic machines so all districts have advanced level of test and people who think they have TB they can go to these centers and get them checked now this measure is aimed to enhance the detection level in the country because only when you can detect TB then only you treat them right so this is what the government has done now has this steps resulted into success the answer is yes because according to wh's [2683.24s] Global TB report it noted that the India has witnessed 17.7% decline in TB incidences between 2015 and 2023 now this is double the rate that is 2x more than the world has level to achieved also India diagnosed as many as 251 lakh patient making a significant [2714.00s] rise in the treatment coverage which was earlier just 59% of the people who were diagnosed with TB were treated and now it has increased to 85% that is as many as 85% of the people who are detecting TB they are getting treatment by the government also TB related deaths in our country has declined by almost 1/5 times from 28 per lak of population to just 22 [2745.76s] per lak population now this highlights that the government has able to control TB to somewhat good extent but there's somewhat more ground that needs to be covered and for that the government has launched a 100 day campaign now this 100 day campaign is a part of a broader framework called National TB elimination program which looks to reduce the incidences of TB in in case you have TB it looks to enhance the diagnostic and [2777.24s] treatment capabilities and not just treat the patient but also address their socioeconomic impact of the disease because any person who suffering ing from TB naturally will not be able to work and that is why their income levels will be suffered and for that the government as I've already highlighted here is providing a direct benefit transfer of rupees 1,000 to the patients now the major focus of this 10day",

who have other diseases as well such as diabetes HIV or they're suffering from malnutrition because such existing disease makes people weak and makes them more susceptible to have grievances or grieve

treatment initiation because earlier you initiate the treatment the earlier is when you reduce the number of deaths related to TB so this was the article related to TB and with this we move to another article [2869.56s] in the oper section of Indian Express which is written by a former CEO of Niti AOG Mr parmeswar a year now this portal highlights the success of a pragati platform which is a platform to monitor the infrastructure projects in our country now infrastructure growth in our country has been phenomenal in the recent years it has led to creation of airports better trains better roads more efficient power networks and this is all due to the pragati platform what is this [2901.48s] pragati platform we will look into in this discussion now this pragati platform is an abbreviation for proactive governance and timely implementation it is a multi-pose and multiportal platform which is aimed to address Common Man Grievances and simultaneously Monitor and review important infrastructural projects now just the union government projects are monitored no but rather governments both at Central and state level and their projects are monitored [2933.60s] by this platform which is monitored by the PM himself now this platform bundles three latest technologies that is digital data management video conferencing for better interaction as well as geospatial technology to assess the impact on ground now what are the features of this platform it has a three- tiered scheme that is pmo at the Apex level Union government secretaries at the second level and chief secretaries [2966.16s] of respect itive States at the third level all these three people or sections of groups they sit together and they monitor individual infrastructural projects and the purpose of this monitoring is to expedite the execution because earlier or by earliest you can construct any infrastructure project the benefits of it will be available to people at the earliest possible time also the feature of this platform is that uh pm has monthly video conferences [2997.84s] which is held on fourth wedness day of each month called as pragati day to discuss the flagged issue now how does PM identifies which project is facing from issues and he does so when public highlights such grievances to the pmo and ongoing programs and pending projects they are uploaded 7 days prior to pragati day which is efficiently monitored by the pmo and presented in front of prime minister himself [3029.52s] now in case prime minister Flags any infrastructure project it has to be issued within 3 days of the meeting and then the rectification measures will be taking place now the pmo reviews the data again after rectification and only after that it has been sanctioned now the system it integrates data from the Gans cell of Union government that is cprrs Project monitoring group as well as the ministry of statistics and [3059.80s] program implementation now the design of this platform is such that whenever the PM reviews the issue the same issue will be highlighted on the screen and the latest update and visuals using the video conferencing and geospatial Technology will will be available in front of PM siiz so the accountability of secretaries of Union government and state government in this case if with the prim Minister directly and this prompts quick resolution of any [3092.44s] grievances now what are the benefits of pragati why is government going so hard on pragati platform it is because it wants to deliver good governance and how is government delivering good governance first of all it is ensuring transparency and accountability that in any case some project is delayed it has been highlighted uh adequately and responsible people are hold accountable to it further it aims to bring all [3123.72s] stakeholders be it pmo be it the union government and its respective Ministries or the chief secretary of the state governments on one platform and the aim is not to highlight their shortcomings rather resolving the issues and issue clearances to the hold up projects also this leads to efficient and responsive governance and it also expedites long pending projects for example there was this bogy be bridge in Assam which was pending for [3155.12s] long and it was constructed after the intervention made by PM using the pragati platform now there are many keywords also which are mentioned in the article and can be asked by upsc in one form or the other first is a Swagat platform which was a digital platform that was started when Prime Minister Modi was the chief minister of the state of Gujarat and it was done to address people's grievances another platform or portal is called pares which is a platform that [3187.48s] provides streamlined environmental clearances to companies who apply for environmental clearances for their infrastructural projects now before starting this portal the approval time could have stretched to 600 days however it has been just 70 to 70 5 days in current times now why is pragati platform so important because India wants to increase its investment in infrastructure because only after you [3217.68s] create necessary infrastructure you'll be able to get higher economic growths in the country right that is why RBI highlights for every one rupee that you invest in infrastructure the return will be 2.5 to 3.5 times so this is the benefits related to pragati platform now let us solve the practice question with reference to pragati platform consider the following [3248.20s] statements it is a unique platform that integrates three Technologies digal data management video conferencing and geospatial Technology a correct statement it is designed to cooperation only among the Ministries and Departments of Union government incorrect it also takes into account both Union as well as state government so second statement here is incorrect the third statement the platform is exclusively managed by EO which provides [3279.28s] regular updates to prime ministers on its project progress again incorrect it is managed by the prime minister's office and not Niti AOG so only first statement here is correct that is why option C is the right answer sorry I've conducted an error option will be C only one statement is correct so we move to last article of the day which appeared in the Press information Bureau called beneficiaries under pradan [3312.40s] monry kissan manhan y now this article highlights that as many as 24.6 6 lakh of farmers have been registered for this scheme which is a central sector scheme Central sector scheme means 100% of the contribution to this scheme is made by the union government with no contributions from state government now the scheme intends to create a Social Security net for small and marginal farmers during their old age now is only [3346.52s] small and marginal Farmers eligible the answer is no all farmers are eligible but this is focusing more on small and marginal Farmers which consist of of almost 85% of total farmers in our country now it is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme and the pension will be available to Farmers after they attain the age of 60 years the farmers who are eligible are between 18 to 14 years and they are to get minimum monthly pension of rupees 30 [3378.28s] 3,000 after they attain 60 years now the contribution to the scheme is made by both government as as well as Farmers themselves that is Farmers they have to uh pay between 5 55 to 200 rupees every month and government also makes a matching contribution to their pension account and this scheme will be managed by the Life Insurance Corporation of India limited who acts as a pension fund manager [3410.48s] so now let us solve the last practice question with reference to pradhanmantri kissan Mandan consider the following statement it is a voluntary contributory pension scheme aimed at providing monthly pension to Farmers after the attainment of 60 years of age correct the second statement the scheme is exclusively available to small",

                  "content": "welcome everybody to optimizing business planning with AI driven scenario forecasting um and we go ahead uh just you know today uh I'm really excited to introduce our panel uh first we have Dr Jan gamad head of AI platform at iy gu Labs he comes to us with a wealth of experience as a computer science lecturer at both Stanford and MIT [30.68s] and of course you prior to that he earned his PhD in machine learning from MIT and did significant contributions at Google um including working on the open source data Commons project we also have V sinna who leads our Enterprise product team at iyy he also has a strong background in Enterprise data products so notably head of product for adobe's pioneering B2B customer data platform maretto analytics and then also Google ads growth platform and then last but not least of course we have ranji Jose [61.44s] who leads our applied Ai and solutions team so he's doing a lot of work with our customers has extensive experience in GTM strategy and data driven Solutions and is uh doing a lot of the things that are um really empowering our organizations uh that we work with to harness their data so lots of great talent here on this call and with that jeang I'll kick it off to you sounds good thank you Alex um so hi everyone really excited to be back here with you after than Thanksgiving holiday in the US um and so uh the first thing I [93.64s] thought we'd do is this is the fourth session in this webinar series um and I wanted to sort of maybe take stock of where we are along this journey uh and I will hopefully help situate some of what we have uh we're going to talk about today and hopefully answer some of your questions uh trying to situate that a little better in terms of how this is part of the mix uh so we started off uh it feels like quite a little while ago uh on the first uh webinar of the series [124.56s] where D talked about you know time series forecasting as a problem space in general uh talked about a lot of things relating starting from data trying to get some basic analyses done uh and then essentially going from there into more advanced uh toolings and techniques like anomaly detection cohorts uh and then going to the business end of things generating forecasts and sort of peeking ahead a little bit on how what do we want to do with those forecasts different kinds of optimization problems [154.76s] different kinds of planning and leading into things like what if scenario uh planning which is something that we'll touch upon today uh and there are other specialized things which you'll hear about in the next uh webinar around new product introductions and how to think about some of things some of the things where you want to forecast things but you have no history to go by uh how should you go about thinking about some of those things so they sort of laid the framework for that and then we got right into the uh weeds of things uh we in the next webinar vayak talked about you know [187.32s] different uh regime different types of algorithms for forecasting time series forecasting in particular uh and sort of contrasting it with statistical models uh deep learning based Solutions Transformers being the most modern iteration contrasting some of this time series forecasting with llms and the llm equivalent in the Transformer world which is what we call Foundation models for time series forecasting holding a lot of Promise these days uh and and certainly something that you must have [217.84s] heard about and be thinking about as well and then obviously touching some graphical modeling and Matrix estimation based techniques that we tend to really prefer here at igy uh because they're computationally not as intensive uh don't require the world's data to be trained uh and sort of are very uh highly performant uh is what we have found in both in terms of accuracy and also in terms of the compute resources and then last time uh we sort of transitioned from there into uh thinking even if you have the best forecasting [248.72s] algorithms you have to help them out a little bit uh it's rare that the data that you have in its in in in its raw form is something you want to just directly feed into these algorithms uh and so we talked about a lot of sort of quote unquote AI techniques or modern statistical and machine learning techniques to dve even more value from your data before they've even gone to the forecasting step so thinking about how could we cluster some of those things better to allow you to learn better uh trying to uh you know think about auxiliary data which we'll talk [280.16s] about today as well and external data how to incorporate that uh if your data has missing values how do you estimate some of those things before you even get to the forecasting and and so we discussed a lot of those sorts of things uh which is you know gotten us to where we are today uh the journey started from sort of 30,000 ft level went deep deep ER into what are the algorithms which is what everybody's wondering about when you think of forecasting and then sort of boosting forecasting accuracy uh with some of the things that you can do clever things that you can do out of the [310.80s] box uh before you even get to the forecasting stage so uh then uh we get into the world of what's next if you have a great forecast are you done and hopefully the answer I think uh we can into it uh based on our discussions across the board with a wide variety of customers is the answer is usually no that's just the beginning that's just the start uh and so the first uh important thing is uh if I told you we have the best-in-class algorithms and we have done the best-in-class uh clever uh [342.96s] pre-processing uh and we are really confident about what we are doing in terms of generating forecasts would you believe me uh and so there are various kinds of audiences who I would need to convince before you can really or the audience can really trust me that we know that this is the best in class forecast uh some of the answers are slightly easier and more numeric and Metric driven for instance uh accuracy metrics you can have W Mapes weighted Mapes Mapes uh r squared mean squared errors rmsc all of those different kinds [375.08s] of metrics depending on what you want to choose and what makes sense for your data uh you can do this sort of accuracy on holdout sets uh or you can do back testing over longer durations you can also Reserve certain parts of your data uh which the model has never seen or been tuned towards and essentially see how well it's performing in terms of accuracy but for that you need to have the actuals uh and then of course there's another element is accuracy the only thing that matters uh typically we notice in businesses when you talk about uh performance forecasting performance [406.76s] people uh will ask questions around if I was forecasting something that is going to happen 12 weeks from now well next week that thing will be closer to those 12 weeks it will be 11 weeks later and then the week after it will be even closer and then eventually in the 11th week from now it that 12th week would just be one week away uh if we looked at if we generated a plot every single week uh and we showed that there was extremely high variance uh of the forecast then you would start to sort of feel uneasy uh either there is an [437.24s] explanation there's so much change going on uh that it makes sense that the forecasts are all over the place or perhaps the modeling and the algorithms we' have thrown at this problem aren't quite doing what they are so forecast AB ility is a pretty important sort of metric to consider uh you can make it as metric driven as you want uh but generally speaking you would like to see some sort of a narrow distribution of forecast ideally if the conditions aren't changing too much so those can tend to be very metric driven and uh you can essentially make your case around [467.36s] those but when we talk about decision makers that could be anyone from the front producing the forecast to the data science sort of teams to the business managers to the SE Suite or anyone who is your target audience who eventually has to make it decision based on those forecasts how do you convince them is accuracy is just one part of the picture stability is another part small part of the picture uh there are other things that you'll need to do especially talking about you know things that we discussed last time around cohorts uh our things are our time series that you know behave similarly think similar [499.08s] products and their selling profiles uh do they also tend to come out if you cluster them together in the forecast regime in the forecast area do they come out to be looking similar as well if not then how do you explain it uh year-on-year comparisons are a very common thing with businesses which is uh even if this year is very different than last year can we put on what things were looking like can we compare it to what things look like last year because that will really help inform what you're seeing today perhaps or help you really focus on why things are so different uh [529.64s] and then decomposition which we have discussed previously also tends to be a favorite uh because you uh usually B you're impacted by business cycles and seasonalities and gener Trends and effects of recency or Auto regression if you want to use a more technical term the effect of covariates U and other kind of auxiliary data uh things like holiday effects and promotions you want to essentially be able to isolate impacts of all of those things to be able to explain why your forecast is saying doing something as an example if [560.72s] you if you just showed a enormous spike in sales forecasted uh next week or let's say uh towards the end of this month uh but that spike is completely disconnected from everything you've seen",

                  "content": "you'll need to do especially talking about you know things that we discussed last time around cohorts uh our things are our time series that you know behave similarly think similar [499.08s] products and their selling profiles uh do they also tend to come out if you cluster them together in the forecast regime in the forecast area do they come out to be looking similar as well if not then how do you explain it uh year-on-year comparisons are a very common thing with businesses which is uh even if this year is very different than last year can we put on what things were looking like can we compare it to what things look like last year because that will really help inform what you're seeing today perhaps or help you really focus on why things are so different uh [529.64s] and then decomposition which we have discussed previously also tends to be a favorite uh because you uh usually B you're impacted by business cycles and seasonalities and gener Trends and effects of recency or Auto regression if you want to use a more technical term the effect of covariates U and other kind of auxiliary data uh things like holiday effects and promotions you want to essentially be able to isolate impacts of all of those things to be able to explain why your forecast is saying doing something as an example if [560.72s] you if you just showed a enormous spike in sales forecasted uh next week or let's say uh towards the end of this month uh but that spike is completely disconnected from everything you've seen this month or previous month you would naturally wonder why and perhaps it's promotions that you're expecting to run or perhaps it's holidays that you're expecting that are going to really impact those things unless you have that explainability it might be harder uh to build that faith and trust in the forecast and so this is a natural [590.88s] Evolution from where we were before into now getting into building more trust and explainability uh and of course as uh you know as I'm sure a lot of you will uh agree decomposition that we just talked about is really important not just for you not just for the one stakeholder or decision maker but across the board really helps uh explaining away a lot of things that you're observing uh which is really important as we start to uh sort of think about deploying and doing something useful with the forecast really relying on them [621.48s] to make your business decisions um and then as we move on from there uh of course understanding the outcome which is you know decomposition and accur icies and stability things that I just talked about uh trying to contrast things with history trying to sort of answer questions around when was the last period that this particular series of interest uh behaved like this in its own history or perhaps in a related products history and so all of those are part of the understanding the outcome then you actually get into a very important part of this feedback loop [653.28s] which is the expert in the loop expert feedback there are people like yourselves who work with your data and perhaps worked with them for years and decades and sometimes can intuitively also understand when when the forecasting perhaps isn't quite right or maybe needs a little bit of help and nudging because you know things that you couldn't model or weren't part of the mix uh in that case perhaps you want to provide some Correctional guidance and then go and regenerate the forecast perhaps you want to overrule the forecast in some cases and say no I am very confident that this is how this [684.08s] thing will go uh and so I don't need forecast to be uh you know out of hundreds of forecasts perhaps some of them you're very confident about or don't want an automated forecast and then all of this sort of starts leading into uh things that you might wonder what if I change something what if I changeed some part of the input can I expect the output to change hopefully the answer to that is yes uh but then there are more subtle things that could change as well which is what we're going to talk about now today because that's really starting to get into the core of [714.20s] once you believe the forecasting algorithm and the setup is right then you can start going uh you know really driving a lot more value out of these by experimenting more by asking more questions changing more things and really seeing the impact of some of those things come out so as an example uh and this you don't need to necessarily read this slide uh this is essentially just a a scenario around how do you model if you were thinking of modeling a demand accurately in a complex and uncertain environment this is a very common generic statement [744.68s] across the board which may apply to you and a lot of others uh that you know about a lot of businesses obviously care about this and here are a couple of scenarios here that we've listed out for you these are hypothetical of course uh and then you may want to make an outcome decision do I do both of those things do I do a combination of them do I do one versus the other uh but the really important thing to think about is that this is a very complex domain forecast is only one part of it uh a lot of inputs that will go into making these decisions might themselves be comprised of multiple forecasts uh and multiple [776.12s] levels of complexity so for instance you may be thinking coming at it from an inventory management uh perspective uh how will uh you know stocking similar things affect not just its sales but does it cannibalize something else uh how will it behave versus a competitor uh that may already be in the market with some of these things uh sales and revenue obviously the impact how does weather impact some of these things can you expect sales from a new introduction or from an existing product to continue to sort of Boom or go Bust or continue [806.84s] in the same vein uh shipping and logistic istics is a big part uh even if I tell you scenario a or scenario B is great how do you make sure that uh your shipping and Logistics is lined up to actually serve the demand that you're anticipating um of course store operations come into this mix as well can you even if I told you you want to stock a hundred of a certain type of a shoe uh as my best decision uh well what if your stores can't actually house them uh because they have a lot of inventory already on hand or they just don't have the capacity or the equipment or [837.52s] anything else that's required in this and then of course the impact Downstream and Upstream on Supply chains uh how do they factor into all of these things if the weather sort of takes a a dramatic turn uh over the over the course of the next couple of months you might be anticipating it or maybe not uh how will that sort of disrupt different things that are part of the mix so obviously a very complex set of domains not one solution is going to solve all of those problems but uh what we are trying to sort of get across is that this is a complex web of things and you might want [868.16s] to essentially think about how we can break different parts of this to essentially allow you to answer you know bit by bit of all of these things one by one and of course the Holy Grail is that you would want to eventually arrive at your decision ideally in a probabilistic way uh with some uncertainties that are part of this uh taking as many of these things into account as possible so uh that sounds great uh one thing I'll take you back to uh at this point which was from last time was this issue of uh this this terminology around auxiliary data [898.28s] uh sometimes we can call it intervention data as well uh just to sort of because this will become important in the next slide I wanted to sort of introd reintroduce this here uh what are interventions interventions can sometimes be things that are you know maybe in your control maybe not in your control so in your control would be perhaps how you price your own products and so you have a history of those and perhaps uh these are the levers that you can pull and plan around in the future when you're thinking of scenario planning I could have many options of how to price different things [929.48s] uh marketing spends of course uh you may have a range of possibilities that you want to try for the future but you have a bunch of history about your your own uh decisions there in the past of course inventory levels and and those sorts of things are part of this as well uh and then of course there is auxiliary data which may be something that is not necessarily Interventional you don't get to control it uh but that may be something that's coming exogenous to you but may impact the entire thing so if you have if your competitor take actions uh if your competitor is essentially [959.52s] introducing a similar product for instance you may already have advanced either knowledge or anticipation of it or they may already have introduce something and you can learn from this because sometimes uh that kind of data may be available publicly to to you as well in studying your market and studying your surroundings and of course you know weather could be another input into these sorts of things where you may not control it but that may determine a lot of what goes on in your business perhaps so this is an important sort of thing to consider the the thing to highlight here is that this is not the [990.76s] stuff typically that you're interested in forecasting the forecasts are what you care about let's say sales or demand or or those sorts of things uh except uh when it comes to these levers that you may or may not be in your control they that may directly impact some of those things and their relationships with each other so we need to be able to model this in a way uh that allows you to study the impact and isolate the impact of some of these things uh so uh just getting into essentially uh the more sort of specific terminology",

here is that this is not the [990.76s] stuff typically that you're interested in forecasting the forecasts are what you care about let's say sales or demand or or those sorts of things uh except uh when it comes to these levers that you may or may not be in your control they that may directly impact some of those things and their relationships with each other so we need to be able to model this in a way uh that allows you to study the impact and isolate the impact of some of these things uh so uh just getting into essentially uh the more sort of specific terminology around [1021.84s] scenario planning sometimes you may call it what if analysis I think some of you answered the poll saying that uh you do have some basic what if scenario planning and what if analyses around what if I move things up and down by a little bit perhaps stating amounts perhaps things that you're aware of uh that you've already tried in the past and perhaps you want to be able to use some of those things in the future and so what if what if analysis or scenario planning interchangeably used uh one versus the other and of course in apparently why these are important is because in all kinds of forecasting [1052.32s] tasks or otherwise business planning tasks there is usually a trade-off to consider uh there is not no such thing as making infinite money uh for from your sales perhaps you know the costs are an important Dimension to determining how much revenue or how much profit you're going to generate as well uh Supply demand obviously is a balance cash in versus Cash Out is important as well uh you know should you invest now or should you hold off and do it later uh there are obvious trade-offs and obvious costs associated with each of them and then should you decide to run a [1083.92s] promotion now or not if you do how by how much all of those sorts of things are important sort of trade-offs to consider uh and then of course and we won't dive too deep into it but I do want to mention here and I'm sure a lot of you already have been thinking about this is uh when we talk about interventions especially the interventions say that you care you ideally want to isolate the causal impact of those interventions uh and so what do I mean by causal is not just a correlational uh thing that you observe but also something that you can isolate [1115.44s] as the lever that you pull which directly causes an outcome you want to be able to at least model things or allow yourself to model things so that you can uh you can study the causal impact because otherwise there may be a lot of interference otherwise there may be a lot of confounders uh where perhaps the uh you know the thing that you thought is correlate is causing is only merely correlated and there's something else that's actually causing either both behaviors or one of those behaviors in an Ideal World of course uh we would love to run randomized control trials um [1147.00s] but that's typically not possible uh because they are either uh very costly or there may not be a possibility if you're doing some sort of trial where uh you want to study the adverse impact of some decisions that you make and you already know it will have an adverse impact you probably don't want to try it out uh but in some cases perhaps the cost is low and you can you can try those things as well a lot of what we are going to discuss are things with where rcts are actually nearly impossible to run and so what you have at your disposal is uh longitudinal studies or things from your past or [1177.36s] historical data that you can then try to piece together uh based on historical experience how perhaps you can reason about causal effects even of things that you may not have tried in the past and that is starting to get into uh what's the sort of more modern sort of at least thinking around some of these things if you could only forecast or plan around scenarios about things that you have seen in the past either through your experience or somebody else's experience then that's great but that might be more limited uh what's more interesting is [1209.20s] how the complex web of interactions between the things you care about between the things that may or may not be in your control how might they individually interact with things uh how might the pricing of one thing help you not just increase the sales of that thing which is perhaps a great outcome but lower the sales of something else and cannibalize those things and net net perhaps that's not a good outcome so you want to essentially be able to study them in a in a combined sort of a way for lack of a better an analogy because we sort of uh believe in constructing a lot of these things at e in terms of the [1240.44s] language of graphs for instance graphs tend to be a natural way to model some of these things because there are relationships all across that you want to study the impact of and of course the need is that you want to the past is the past uh you can use that for back testing and all those things the need is how do you actually uh estimate the effect of these interventions into the future and then in order to get there you hopefully want to know that the the system that you built on which will be relying on a lot of simulations and forecasts is something you can rely and [1270.84s] Trust so that you're never going back and questioning it all the time questioning the basis of what these uh scenarios are based on so I'll stop right here uh this was a you know Whirlwind sort of high level tour of things and I I wanted to sort of uh invite my colleague Ranjit here uh to give us a little bit of a insight into what some of these things may look like in practice uh based on some of his and some of our Collective sort of experience and what we are hearing from our customers and clients so I'll stop [1301.96s] right here and uh I have Ranjit take over uh and then I'll mute myself as well great thank you jangar uh yeah that was a great overview in terms of a lot of the theoretical Concepts that we need to be thinking about um as we think about uh forecasting and really thinking through the different word of scenarios and and my goal is to make sure that all of you who are attending get uh a little bit more of the the aspects of how you could be doing this and obviously I'm going to [1333.12s] be quickly showing this from the perspective of the iyy platform uh but I want to start out by grounding Everyone by you know uh talking about the fact that everything we do from a forecast analysis what of scenarios in the end has to drive uh business value and so from that perspective um you know from a iyy perspective we're always trying to make sure that everything is you know made available uh through a set of insights through a set of kpis which are easily understandable by the folks who really care about it so in this case it [1364.08s] could be executive leadership um realizing that hey there was a plan that was set up for fi25 but the forecasting teams already starting to say that the plan essentially could be missed and and and we might want to start uh making considerations around uh innoventions to to apply and so from that perspective we always want to make sure that you know all of these are easily understandable easily available to the right folks and you know the key kpis that you would want to like keep track of on a regular basis are easily available all driven by [1395.72s] sophisticated uh forecasting and water if analysis from U the ikai platform um these are a set of uh kpis here in the demo app but these are all configurable from your own perspective in terms of what's uh what's important for your uh organization uh another thing I want to call out is everything that I'm going to show you quickly over the next 10 minutes uh you know while can be consumed through the iiga UI all of this is powered by API so from that perspective can also be fed into your own systems that you know your leadership your uh key folks might be uh [1428.20s] using and so these are not insights and data points that you need to necessarily uh uh view from the iyai perspective itself uh but keeping um you know on with you know being able to easily understand um the idea is that you want to be able to you know be able to do a forecast and then look at what's really driving all of these and then be able to understand you know what might be key growth rates associated with all this but then really you know be able to look what does that forecast look like against plann every organization is [1459.64s] always planning ahead and when they're planning ahead there are lots of you know decisions and choices being made but then as data is coming in with regards to what what the sales look like this week uh",

fed into your own systems that you know your leadership your uh key folks might be uh [1428.20s] using and so these are not insights and data points that you need to necessarily uh uh view from the iyai perspective itself uh but keeping um you know on with you know being able to easily understand um the idea is that you want to be able to you know be able to do a forecast and then look at what's really driving all of these and then be able to understand you know what might be key growth rates associated with all this but then really you know be able to look what does that forecast look like against plann every organization is [1459.64s] always planning ahead and when they're planning ahead there are lots of you know decisions and choices being made but then as data is coming in with regards to what what the sales look like this week uh last month um you know last quarter um all of that essentially uh uh can be you know essentially uh used from a forecasting perspective for you to like start taking a look at what does the future look like and so being able to have all these data points easily available uh makes it easy for you to be able to look at what does the future [1490.76s] look like and are there changes that we need to be making uh at the right point in time now continuing on um you know uh what's really important you know you know about all these forecasts is while the platform you know can produce a forecast what you want to be able to do also is understand and Trust the forecast and so from that perspective one of the key things that iy guy always does is essentially you know anytime you know we we we're essentially training models um there's training data which is based on historical actuals um there's [1522.48s] part of that data that set set aside from a validation perspective and few different ways for you to be able to know now look at that and really gain the trust in the forecast s so here what you're seeing is essentially all the data that's in red is essentially real data but it's also training data and then based on that we have you know the forecast you know that's been essentially generated for the the future period in this case two years now what we can also do is overlay that with you know real data but essentially for a Val from a validation perspective and so [1553.92s] here the yellow data that or the yellow you know sort of uh uh bar chart that you see there is essentially real data but essentially used from validating the forecast perspective and then as we look into the future what we can also uh do is uh spot check that with you know what's happened the last year and overlay that with you know what's essentially forecasted to be able to really get to a a good understanding of are the forecasts that are coming out of you know the igy platform you know [1584.08s] something that I trust and something I feel good about so lots of different ways for us to be a able to ensure that you're understanding the forecast you're able to Overlay that with uh not only real data uh from the current period but also be able to pull past periods and then overlay that to get a sense of you know is this you know forecast going the right direction now now when we forecast there's also a lot of sophisticated capabilities that's going on underneath the hood and one of [1614.76s] it is essentially as you can imagine any organization you have a a deep hierarchy of what that data looks like you know let's think about a consumer electronics company with their sales so you start with the Topline revenue of the company but then you might have uh different divisions that are in charge of particular products you go down you have product families and then you have uh the SKS themselves and if you really explore that out you essentially have lots of different time series starting with a skew but all the way up top and [1645.04s] so being able to make sure that you a for cast at every level so that every sort of group associate let's say the the the executive leadership and the CEO cares mostly about the top line but particular you know product family managers might care about their particular product family and so you do want forecast at all levels but then you want to make sure that they all reconcile up and so that's one of the key capabilities that eugy provides where you're reconciling all your different forecasts at all the different levels and one of the things that we can [1675.44s] see here is that when you actually look at the let's the Topline forecast by itself it looks like this but when you actually add the reconciliation now you can see how a lot more of that realistic data uh is incorporated and then when you overlay that with you know the real data you can basically take a look at you know how that really you know uh matches up with the forecast and so being able to uh you know use some of these sophisticated techniques uh in terms of uh feeding into the forecast but then ensuring that you have easy [1705.76s] tools to be able to you know essentially uh check that and make sure that you know you're validating that against Real data is something that's really helpful and if we go deeper down you know from an explainability perspective there are lots of things as as jangir mentioned that are essentially driving um you know the end result or the end data now in this case what we're seeing is the fact that uh it is the holiday period and there is a particular holiday promotion that's essentially being driven and so from that perspective you know what we can see is that there is a [1738.36s] big component you know essentially contributing to the total sales that's really driven by the holiday period and uh we can actually see the seasonality aspect of it is actually depressing the the the the total sales but when we put all of it together that's essentially how we're getting what that total sales looks like and how we can break that down in terms of the different components and then start to get a better understanding of which part of you know the the the decompose aspect is feeding the most into the forecast at a [1769.68s] particular point of time and then be able to look at that from a historical perspective and then uh essentially get to a better understanding of you know what's what's really driving this and so at a high level you know what we've done so far is being able to really look at some of the key insights being able to look at you know some of the kpis that are driven and then really go through understanding the forecast through a few different techniques uh and then now at this point when we have a reasonable confidence of what our forecast look like this is the point [1800.32s] where we want to now do a little bit more advanced uh capabilities like what of analysis and so from that perspective as uh jangar was talking about there are aspects that you control the intervention so marketing spend is a great example that's something that you can always adjust as a as as a company policy but there are also uh auxiliary aspects or auxiliary data that you don't control so great example CPI index we see a lot of our customers now asking about the potential impact of tariff and those are things that you don't control [1831.24s] but these are different things that you want to be able to use from a water of perspective and so when you really look at you know the ability to run water scenarios on a few of these so in this case what we're going to try and do is increase the marketing spend by 10% so if I you know uh remind you what we started with is the company realizing that was going to miss plan and so here you know one of the things that we're going to try and see is if we can increase the marketing spe what does that look like and then being able to really run that forecast look at okay [1863.24s] what do the new numbers look like and then being able to now compare the base scenario versus the water scenario so in this case what we have is the base scenario without the extra 10% marketing span and the water scenario now with the extra 10% marketing span but also the ability for you now to look at the individual sort of uh uh you know sort of skew level at a region level so as I said you know I will help you forecast all the way down to skew region store Etc in terms of whatever gr you need and [1895.80s] now having that data available not only for you to be able to do a sanity check but obviously also making that data available to all the different uh stakeholders whether it's a product un know manager whether it's a department head or the uh executive leadership uh obviously makes it extremely valuable and then finally you know being able to go a little bit more deeper where you might have mult multiple scenarios where you're trying a few different things and essentially now with all these different scenarios you want to be able to compare that in this case you know what we've [1926.64s] done is added a couple of different scenarios with plus 10% marketing span plus 25% marketing span and",

different things and essentially now with all these different scenarios you want to be able to compare that in this case you know what we've [1926.64s] done is added a couple of different scenarios with plus 10% marketing span plus 25% marketing span and now you want to be able to actually look at these and see when you select those what does that look like and so being able to see all of this in one single uh uh screen being able to you know use some of the techniques that we looked at below where you can overlay sales data and then be able to also look at the decomposed data you know essentially makes it extremely valuable where you can not only look at the top level comparisons but also go [1956.84s] down to the skew level comparisons and then be able to understand that and then be able to obviously inform the necessary groups within the company in terms of what this can look like and so that's at a high level where I wanted to give you a quick overview of how if you gu can help you starting all the way to from you know looking at the insights looking at top top kpis understanding the forecast but then being able to drive all these multiple scenarios um so that you know you're able to essentially uh compare these and [1987.12s] then inform the different groups uh uh with regards to this so with this I will end my piece and uh I I think we're all TR to get some good really good questions but before that I believe we have a poll which my colleague Alex is going to queue up as we're moving into questions uh you know teeing up jongar I believe you wanted to kind of give a special intro to our uh to Our Guest VI absolutely hi I'm back uh I just wanted to thank uh VI for joining this uh VI is uh heading the platform team at iiy he [2018.24s] joined us from Google and has spent a lot of his time thinking around the kind of questions that we were discussing today it's a very very deep long winded topic obviously as all of you are aware because it really there's there ways to get this done in a very rudimentary way and then there it is much harder to sort of think about it in terms of how to do it in a more holistic way really trying to answer and solve the business challenges so we're very lucky to have him because uh I would love to make sure that you know all of you get to also hear what he's observing uh from his [2050.12s] perspective around scenario planning forecasting and these things in the business environment given a broad range of industries that he talks to and listens to uh and what's needed and how to sort of think about this in a more principled manner uh so thank you VI for joining and uh Alex I think we have a couple of questions at least on the uh Q&A coming in so you have a better handle of that so I'll let you sort of ask the question perfect and we do actually so of course people are immediately wanting to understand how [2080.28s] are we doing this in real life what are we applying this to um I had a specific question come through around uh pricing so you know could be B2B price elasticity um you know but Brad more broadly I know we are doing some things with pricing as well so maybe you can kind of speak to what we've seen um seen around that and then you know further what are are some of the other common challenges use cases that we're running into yeah no I thank you janir for the extremely kind [2111.00s] introduction um so I think that's a that's a that's an interesting question I think you mentioned pricing one of the questions was around pricing and pricing as an intervention um it's definitely one of uh one of the major use cases that we actually solve for our customer customers even today and uh I mean the short of it is you know it's an intervention we model it like an intervention and we are able to predict demand we are able to predict various uh the the impact of that Demand [2142.00s] on your various other uh other kpis uh based on you know uh changes and you know going slightly deeper into it you know pricing can be tackled in multiple ways one is you know obviously you you can you can evaluate pricing at different price points you can also be thinking of pricing uh in terms of discounting so you have a price and then you are actually now thinking of okay if I give a 10% discount 20% discount what does that do to my uh to my overall uh [2172.16s] different set of kpis so for example what does it do to my inventory cost uh what does it do to my overall Roi I may be selling more but inventory cost and the revenue are actually so there are a bunch of tradeoffs uh we are it's one of the most common use cases that we see and I'd be you know very interested to learn more if you want to reach out later on what your specific use cases uh amongst other use cases uh Alex that you brought up um I think being able to uh for example manage your inventory right [2203.16s] Inventory management is a very you know is is again another use case that we very often see and both in terms of there are you know different constraints that our customers typically work with one is sometimes they want to be able to uh be able to manage you know the goal is to basically maximize sales and so you want to be able to obviously infinite inventory can lead to you know inventory infinite you know you'll always meet your sales but you don't want infinite inventory your sales you want to predict what your what your top [2233.68s] line or your what Your in your confidence interval what's the maximum amount of sales that you're expecting and you want to be able to meet that demand in some cases especially in the world of B2B with the and you know specifically you know in some some industry such as manufacturing Etc you may end up with you know long lead time so you want to ensure that you're ordering Optimum amount of inventory uh and whatever is left over there may be instances where you need to now take into expenses and so there are Financial considerations there are demand demand [2264.00s] planning consideration supply chain considerations and we typically also you know a lot of our customers are uh you know using our platform to be able to do scenario planning around what do those scenarios look like thank you um kind of a second sort of related question uh you know how are the customers we're working with currently handling tradeoffs between some of the different business [2294.96s] constraints you know that's that's an interesting question again um I think you know if I you know in talking to customers over the past you know year year and a half um I think customers fall across a varying level of I would say technological maturity when it comes to supply chain planning and so um at whatever level of maturity they are almost always there is an objective right so that objective could be you [2326.56s] know maximizing your service levels you being able to fill orders or being able to for example you know increasing revenue or you know just inventory cost optimization things of that nature and then in almost in in in most cases there is some amount of scenario planning being done right so you you want to be able to then see what are these different scenarios um and then and then and then at from that point I think it starts to there [2357.96s] there is a little bit of uh Divergence in terms of based on the maturity of the organization in many cases there is rule-based decision making that's happening and so you have simple meters like what's you know there is there is a rule-based metric such as you know what's my uh low threshold of inventory what's my upper threshold of inventory that I want to maintain or what's my low threshold of discounting versus what's my upper threshold of pricing that I want to go over right so I think those [2388.80s] thresholds are set and that's what I would call maybe rule based decision making um there's almost always cross functional collaboration also and so you have and this is where again not having sometimes not having a common platform can come into can become an issue where you are actually talking to different teams so for example if you're managing stores you want to be able to call the stores and says I'm not you know what do you expect in this year this is what my forecast is showing things like that and then I think the what what we see definitely in",

issue where you are actually talking to different teams so for example if you're managing stores you want to be able to call the stores and says I'm not you know what do you expect in this year this is what my forecast is showing things like that and then I think the what what we see definitely in terms of shift and what we [2420.12s] are really excited about here at ikyy what personally also excites me is that there is a very clear shift happening where people understand what the issues with the current traditional approaches are just in terms of tool flexibility in terms of in terms of uh you know time to actually be able to run multiple scenarios uh being able to get all teams to have a clear similar view or not just even a similar clear uh single view of the data so that they can actually be [2452.20s] able be be able to participate more collaboratively uh to to kind of decide things I think the next thing really is that there is there's a clear shift to AI that's happening and being able to use AI enabled tools to actually be able to do some of that you know uh prioritization uh being able to actually you know handle those tradeoffs better um I'm excited to see that uh this this last question actually Sparks some followon question so great um uh [2483.04s] you know uh we've got a few coming in but I'll say on the followup on the trade-up question how does iy guy manage situations with multiple objectives um and you know if whoever asks this question has any other specifics they want to add to help us more specifically answer great but I'll kind of start with that you know when we have multiple objectives you're trying to solve for multiple things is there how do we deal with that I I can I can take that um so this is uh in manyways this is obviously more challenging because obviously the [2514.36s] tradeoff uh is usually of the form of you can't win on both um on both metrics right usually there is a little bit of if you win here you might be losing there and so uh without getting into too many details one of the things that we support in the platform think of it as a related thing to what if uh scenario planning is uh sort of just sort of what we call AI plan which is essentially Supply Chain management or things like that where you can simulate based on your forecast and then essentially try to then say what should be the next [2545.52s] steps that you should take think in the supply chain context uh that's very helpful now typically uh how do you optimize around that there's usually uh we will run through many many different simulated scenarios and essentially sketch out for you what we call a Paro curve a Paro operation curve where we'll essentially show you if you turn the knob all the way here versus all the way there how is the profile of expected outcomes going to change across the board usually there is a metric of interest and then there are those tradeoff uh axes that you may be [2575.80s] interested in and then so typically our answer to that solution approach is usually uh we'll simulate a lot we'll simulate lots of scenarios we'll tell you how your metric of Interest sort of changes across those um you know axes of the competing objectives that you care about uh and so then you can essentially uh the goal being that you can hopefully identify the optimal operating point that you are interested in which sort of balances the tradeoffs between uh the multiple objectives that you care about [2607.52s] uh now there are obviously other ways this could you if your if your question is sort of leading into meaning you know you have multiple objectives that you're trying to optimize at the same time how do you do that we we do support that that's slightly less common uh but generally I think that maybe leads into uh sort of a a related uh sort of thing which will need a separate webinar is uh when people often talk about what if scenarios uh they'll talk about sort of often it's a misnomer for optimization uh how do I make the optimal decisions [2638.24s] we don't typically use that in our what if scenario planning sort of tool tool toolkit but at we certainly support optimization as well because eventually you want to know under uncertainty uncertainty typically generated by your forecast for for example what is the optimal set of actions to take even the pricing we have a very large customer uh Works in these sort of uh you know think of it as the insurance domain across this country uh and would love to know how much can I uh how should I lower or increase every [2670.08s] single person's premiums who's up for a renewal in a in every single state um and do it in a way that it observes a lot of sort of constraints that are put on these problems and so what should the pricing look like when there is lots of constraints and so uh that's an optimization problem uh spending across multiple data sets and you know all kinds of real world constraints we certainly support that too I wouldn't necessarily say that's a what if scenario uh because that usually is you kind of model it and then you are able to come up with the optimal decision uh but that's one of the things that we are [2701.04s] also interested in integrating into the future how optimization could also be part of the sort of what if scenario eventually recommend to me maybe perhaps what I should do uh so that's a slightly long answer and hopefully that addressed the question uh but uh if V have something to say otherwise we can definitely move on to yeah I'll just add that and and I don't know if there is uh um I think that the one thing that I will add is that I think these questions are this was a very good question in the sense that there's a real world this is how real world businesses operate they're [2731.68s] seldom just optimizing for one single piece of thing I think what's important is I think you can go solve for this um I think businesses there is another consideration that businesses have is they need to take these decisions in real time right you can do three you don't have you know months and weeks to sometimes respond and this is where I think IAI really excels is where you know you can do these uh you know you know much much faster within in within minutes to hours these kinds of analysis [2764.56s] and then um actually more importantly have realtime feedback loops so you know you have the ability to actually ingest expert inputs you have the ability to constantly refine your forecast based on real world data Etc so that's the only thing that I wanted to add on top of the technical answer that you already provided down here I will say speaking of data that's actually uh especially since everybody said that that was their biggest challenge um and I think what we do at iyy is pretty cool around being able to bring in you know different types of [2795.88s] data different locations all of that um maybe we can kind of speak a little bit to how we're helping solve that data problem uh you're coming to us you're trying to get this going and you know your data is a mess figuring out how to how to start what are some of the things that we do that are are pretty unique there yeah I think uh when it comes to uh um when it comes to data I think that the challenges that we see are you know there are two kinds of challeng but you know I'll basically bucket it into two [2827.72s] parts number one is actually getting all the data sets into one place and you know whatever you're forecasting you know whatever your tool set that you're using it needs to be able to ingest data from multiple uh from multiple sources and in in multiple forms right uh some data will be weekly some data will be monthly some will be at varying levels of hierarchy Etc from your different systems and I'm sure the audience here uh who who work both in Technical and non-technical capacity will appreciate [2858.72s] that and then you actually take that and then on an ongoing basis be able to now model that data so that uh AI can provide the most optimal output and so for example you know uh you know uh you may have extremely sparse dat dat that you want to work with and you want to be able to model it in a way that it kind of uh allows you to forecast something uh that that you mean on a on a with a much greater [2891.16s] accuracy and data modeling starts to become super important and I think uh jangar can speak more to it uh we have you know um if if there",

know um if if there is interest actually we can speak more to it but we have a set of uh connectors do have over 240 connectors that's pre-built super easy to basically just provide your credentials um you know we have byoc capabilities so bring your own run igy within your own uh within your own cloud environment within your own virtual [2922.80s] private Cloud if you want to a lot of large Enterprises need to be able to do that because they can't ship data out to other clouds um and then uh as it relates to just modeling data the platform itself is baked with a whole bunch of uh uh data transformation sort of what we call facets uh where uh somebody uh even you know somebody with a very little understanding of data modeling and uh uh uh a data science background can easily be able to use it in a drag and drop interface to actually [2954.32s] very quickly be able to model data and visualize it and be able to uh then uh utilize uh and improve their forecast anything to add jir if not not then maybe we can move on thank you for the um I know we're coming up on the last five minutes but I had a couple of good questions that have come in um that jangir I know you've you've spoken to in some of the previous webinars so I'll just let you do kind of a recap we got a asking about how iy guy compares to some [2985.44s] of the other um Solutions you know like time GPT and others that are that are out there um and then also a question about how we're utilizing ml to include the external factors so whether promotions things like that maybe you can kind of tackle them both and then we'll and then we'll wrap up awesome uh thank you thank you for asking uh these couple of questions first I will definitely say uh the we have hopefully more detailed answers to these uh from the previous webinars and hopefully you'll be able to find some of the links [3015.88s] to those as well but just to recap yes we certainly Benchmark our algorithms uh against uh you know a lot of existing open-source algorithms uh Foundation models are one of them I believe we've benchmarked against Google's Foundation model uh and there's a report that we can share in our chat uh or as a followup as well it's on our website where we have that and DP and a few other sort of um commonly used sort of algorithms and trying to sort of show you uh different sort of performance metrics around those uh and then of [3047.52s] course uh the short answer is we compare very favor favorably uh it's impossible and you shouldn't believe me if I tell you that every single forecasting problem in the world we will guarantee that our accuracy is going to be better than anything else anyone can come up with that's not usually possible uh but what we want to see evidence of is that our a large number of cases uh such that you are able to either beat uh existing benchmarks or you're able to be very very competitive with them and generally speaking that's the answer that we have for across the board uh but of course the kind of domain that you are [3079.08s] interested in the answer may vary one way or another the thing I would like to make sure I plug also is that the iigi platform is not just uh running our own proprietary algorithms sometimes uh the data is best suited for existing let's say as an example an ARA model which is very well studied and open source implementations and you know our own implementations are based off of public uh sort of algorithm descriptions if that works best for your data we want to be able to use that and support that as well so we are not necessarily only tied [3111.72s] to our own proprietary algorithms which we know work really well across the board but that whenever that is not the case we are also not going to in instead restrict you to just use them so that's one answer around comparisons uh and then the second one was around essentially how are we using external data uh like historical sales or uh be besides historical sales because I would imagine historical sales are going to be part of your primary uh series uh but you may have other series of interest uh so that's multi and dimensional forecasting but also uh how do you [3143.72s] include weather and promotions and price increases and change changes and whatnot we have what we call uh the ability to provide auxiliary data which is also think of it as a Time series we've discussed this previously and hinted upon it today as well we have the ability to provide that and tag it separately than the series that you're actually interested in forecasting so that we can then both do uh forecasting by taking those into account in a slightly special way uh special because these series are typically things that you're not interested in forecasting in the future and in many cases some good [3175.52s] estimate of those or actual values like holidays are already known into the future and so we want to study the impact and essentially then isolate the impact and generate forecast based on those so this is something that we actually handle uh very natively in the platform and I believe we'll be sharing uh different links with you you can def definitely give it a spin uh we have a lot of training material too uh on our website uh through our academy uh where you can practice some of those uh and see how that works out even for your use cases or for the kind of data that we [3207.16s] have made available in those practice sessions awesome thank you um and thank you both of you ofac shangar ranji as well for coming out today um just want to recap you know there's some key takeaways here when you get the deck you can take a look through it and then also a reminder this is one of a series as we mentioned uh all of these are available on demand our last webinar around forecasting new product launches is December 11th that's another good one with some some kind of Cutting Edge [3237.36s] functionality so hope you all join and tell your friends um and then finally as we mentioned uh there's going to be these resources are going to be made available to you so one around operationalizing AI uh one on some of our really I think cool and unique technology uh how we're kind of using applications of time to VC and then uh the white paper that jangir mentioned with some of the benchmarks um all will be sent to you after that so uh also if you stay on there will be a survey please take it if you have a second um [3267.92s] and outside of that thanks for joining us and appreciate everyone coming out today thank you thank you",

mirror murder wherever you get your podcast the CBS News original 60 Minutes opens its art [31.69s] [Music] arives a Syria which is whole uh and that meets the aspirations of his people that's secure and it's stable can make a huge difference uh in the Middle East yeah I'm looking for these pardons these people have been there how long is it 3 or four years this is a chance for President Joe Biden and president-elect [62.40s] Donald Trump to do something different and and to show that they are capable of bringing Austin home hello I'm Caitlyn huy Burns in Washington welcome to America decides we begin with political unrest in Syria president president Bashar al-assad's rule has come to an end he has fled to Russia where he will now live in Exile tonight some refugees are streaming home and political prisoners are getting their first tape of Freedom the big question what's next for the country [93.76s] that has long been gripped by Civil War over the weekend president- elect Trump weighed in on the conflict on social media saying quote the United States should not have anything to do with it this is not our fight let it play out do not get involved our MTS tiab is following the latest from Turkey near the border with Syria well the scenes in the Capitol Damascus are still astonishing to see the fact that we have rebels in the capital in fact some of them inside the [125.64s] presidential Palace others out in the Amad mosque one of the most famous and important holy sites in Syria some of them shooting their guns in the sky with celebratory gunfire two weeks ago few would have believed scenes like that ending what has been perhaps one of the most brutal Civil Wars of our time 13 years over half a million people killed 5 million syrians displaced abroad 10 [156.32s] million internally displac Bashar al-assad the son of Haus al- Assad who uh together over the years have ruled this country for over 54 years with an iron fist with a level of brutality uh that is frankly Indescribable that is now over now many people are asking what is the fure future for Syria when you look at uh the rebels who are in charge now at least nominally in the capital hay Alam many [189.68s] fear that these are islamists who want to impose some sort of religious rule over the country however there have been signals from their leader uh a man by the name of galani suggesting that he wants to bring syrians together regardless uh of their religion or their ethnicity something that has long divided this nation there also poses a question for world leaders in Western capitals from Washington to Paris to London to Brussels do they recognize these Rebel factions who are now in [222.08s] Damascus is there some sort of un mandated plan whatever the case for Syrian people who have suffered so much for so long many believe that this is the Turning of a page hoping that this is the dawn of a new era in their country which has suffered so greatly for so long under the assid regime which is now gone back to you MTS TI up thank you earlier today I [253.00s] discussed the upheaval in Syria with White House National Security Communications adviser John Kirby I began by asking him what role the Biden Administration now has in Syria's future we believe that we can be an important interlocutor if you will uh through the UN a un-led process as well as with counterparts in the region including Communications with some of these opposition groups to try to help bring about a transition to a type of governance in Syria that can actually [284.32s] meet the aspirations of the Syrian people and for as long as he's commander-in-chief he means to continue to use uh America's convening power and Leadership on the world stage to bring that about um this all of course puts a spotlight on American journalist Austin Ty who the president said that he believes he is alive what is that based off of well that is continues to be our assumption uh we have no indication to the contrary uh I think I need to leave it at that in terms of um information [315.48s] that we're looking at uh but we know that the the Ty family has been waiting an awful long time and um we share their deep concerns about Austin And as the president said yesterday we're going to continue to work very very hard to bring him home the events that unfolded uh over the weekend in Damascus may present an opportunity to get a little bit more information uh about where he is uh what condition he's in and what we may be able to do to get him home I don't know that for sure we're not we're not certain of anything it right now uh [347.00s] except that we're going to continue to see what we can do to to bring it to bring him home but right now no one knows where he is I'm not aware that we have any specific information about his actual whereabouts or condition uh we have no indication uh as I said earlier that he's not still alive so we're going to work under that assumption and we're going to do what we can to get them home as you know in less than two months a new Administration is coming in um how have you briefed or worked with the transition uh when it comes to Syria the [379.28s] new incoming National Security adviser uh Congressman Waltz has been in touch with Mr Sullivan our national security advisor they've had numerous conversations we've done uh everything we can to keep them up to speed uh not just on what's going on here over the course of the last 48 hours or so but um the our ceasefire efforts between Israel and Lebanon and our continued efforts to get a hostage deal uh with Hamas to get the hostages home from from uh from Gaza so we have kept uh Mr Waltz informed uh [409.72s] there have been other conversations uh with uh with incoming Trump officials um and obviously we look forward to when the transition team gets fully staffed and um and is able to actually come to the facility here uh to do what we can to continue to get them the contacts they need and and how confident is the president in the incoming president's uh ability to uh work and and making sure there are no risks to American interests [440.32s] here well the president is going to respect President elect elect Trump's uh uh prerogative here in terms of what forign policy objectives he's going to implement and uh and change uh that's going to be up to the incoming team and we recognize that I would say a couple of things number one uh to your earlier question we're going to do everything we can to make sure they have the information they need to make the best decisions and number two in the time that he has left President Biden still [471.44s] is the commander-in-chief he's still the president of the United States and he's going to continue to execute and Implement uh the foreign policy that he has been doing for the last four years which is based on values and principles and American leadership and engagement on the world stage and that engagement um I think is for all the world to see in terms of how things transpired uh in Syria uh yesterday as a result of an outgrowth of our assertive foreign policy and supporting allies and partners uh but also going forward and [501.60s] Assad is believed to be now in Russia yeah president-elect Trump said that Russia is a weakened state are um how does this impact everything going on and especially our interest in Ukraine I don't it's hard to see specifically how Assad's presence in Moscow is going to affect what we're doing with Ukraine I mean I would say first of all Russia needs to be held to account for the support that they gave Assad over the last 14 years and we ought to be asking the Russians some pretty tough questions [532.52s] about why they decided to Harbor now a brutal dictator who killed millions of his own people including with chemical weapons as for Ukraine uh they're still active fighting in the East they're still active fighting around kurur uh the Russians have made some plotting progress so we are surging security assistance to Ukraine you've seen us do that in the last week you're going to see additional packages coming uh in coming days to make sure that Ukraine can can can succeed on the battlefield but just as critically that if and when President zinsky is ready to negotiate [563.92s] some sort of end to this war that he can do it from a position of strength and when it comes to Syria and the how does this impact everything going on the a stable secure well-governed Syria um can actually uh make a huge difference uh throughout the the region in middle in the Middle East we've seen uh what an unstable insecure Syria ungoverned Syria uh can mean par particularly because terrorist networks try to take advantage of that I mean why [595.56s] do we have almost a thousand troops in Syria right now uh certainly they're not there at the invitation of the government they're they're there because Isis has been trying to take advantage and exploit ungoverned spaces there so a Syria which is whole uh and that meets the aspirations of its people that's secure and it's stable can make a huge difference uh in the Middle East and if you're Iran right now and you're waking up and you're looking at what you once saw your influence in the Middle East and seeing what it is now you have to be [625.80s] pretty disheartened",

the Middle East and seeing what it is now you have to be [625.80s] pretty disheartened your axis of resistance is dramatically weaker now nzala is gone sinir is gone and now Assad is gone uh and that is a direct result not only of the poor decision making that Iran and Iranian leaders have made but it's also again an outgrowth of uh a very assertive very collaborative cooperative and multilateral foreign policy that President B's been executed and turning now to the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson police in Pennsylvania today arrested a [657.16s] person of interest in The Killing 20 6-year-old Luigi mangion was taken into custody in Altuna Pennsylvania on Firearms charges that's around 2 hours East of Pittsburgh Police say that he is being questioned in the shooting of Thompson outside a Manhattan hotel last week our Ana Shor has been following this case and joins us now Anna this has been the Manhunt that has gripped the country how did authorities actually find this man and what do we know about [687.72s] him well Caitlyn it was really thanks to somebody who was there at a local McDonald's who saw him inside the McDonald's he was eating a meal and who said you know what that looks like the person that I've seen on TV and called 911 and got local police to come immediately they immediately apprehended him brought him to the local police department that was not far away and found on his person a ghost gun with a silencer they held him there on [719.76s] uh charges of uh illegally being in possession of that firearm they also found a jacket that matched the jacket that the suspect who carried out the attack was wearing he also had a fake New Jersey ID the very same one that the person of interest checked into the hostel up uh on the upper west side with so all of these things uh are making law enforcement very confident that they in fact do have the right person and this Manhunt went on for several [751.80s] days and it it just you know baffles the mind how someone could you know do this in New York City and it takes so long for someone to find him um did authorities give any indication about why it took so long to identify this person well officials tell CBS news that they're not that surprised it took so long he was wearing a face mask for almost the entire 10-day period that he was in New York City which actually really helped him avoid detection because facial recognition did not [783.00s] provide a positive identification on any individual so that was uh a challenge for law enforcement once he was able to flee on his bicycle and get onto a bus departing out of New York City that became a much more complex environment because they didn't even know which bus uh he took he was smart in covering his tracks he did not use a credit card he paid for everything in cash he had fake IDs that he was using to disguise his identity and it worked for about 5 days [814.52s] he made a few mistakes like during that flous exchange with the T with the um clerk at the hospital he pulled down his face mask so that was one mistake and then again just being in a McDonald's he might have 5 days later started to get comfortable thinking that he was in the clear order a meal and sit down and actually eat it in this fast food restaurant um and that was ultimately what brought law enforcement to him amazing to think after all of that caught in a McDonald's of all places um [846.12s] so where does the investigation go from here now that they have a person of interest well we are actually at still at the beginning of this so the the next phase of the uh investigation begins now they still do not have the murder weapon so they are going to be looking for that that's important looking towards motive and putting together this timeline so that a prosecutor can bring a case um that's all going to be happening now uh da Bragg has been working hand inand with the NYPD since last Wednesday 5 [878.56s] days ago so that um has already been in play but that will continue um the motive um interviewing his family members um my reporting indicates that he had not been in communication with his family over the last six months um but it's he's such an unusual person of interest in case like this he was valedictorian of his High School prep school went to University of Pennsylvania um graduated with a master's degree in computer science he [909.68s] had a focus in artificial intelligence this was a high this is a highly intelligent individual who from his social media post appears up until relatively recently to have had an active social life or at least that's what it what it looks like on social media it's just a fascinating case and as you said the investigation is really just beginning Ana Shear you have been all over this for us and I know you will continue to so we'll look forward to your reporting thank you so much happy to be here and over the weekend we got a look [941.64s] into

finding their life savings gone this could happen to anybody and sometimes losing their lives Anything for Love Now streaming on the free CBS News app and welcome back to America decides president-elect Trump is laying out his views on everything from the from immigration to the economy during an interview on Meet the Press this Sunday he said he'd launch sweeping changes on [1159.00s] day one our Edo Keefe joins us now from West Palm Beach which is the headquarters of the Trump transition uh Ed this was Trump's first television interview since winning the election um I'm wondering you know walk us through what the main priorities he laid out for day one which is you know less than two months from now yeah priorities or headlines either way you put it Caitlyn a lot of news made in this thing for example he suggested tariffs are still on the table but couldn't rule out the possibility that prices on everyday goods bought by [1190.80s] Americans might go up so he couldn't guarantee that he says he won't allow Elon Musk and V ramaswami to do much of anything to Medicare Medicaid and social secur as they go about trying to find efficiencies and cost savings across the federal government touching those entitlement programs would potentially come up with billions if not trillions in savings over several years but the president-elect understands that's a political non-starter he says he's going to push for the Trump on era tax cuts to be reinstated they expire in in about a year or so a year or so uh said he'll [1221.36s] pardon most if not all of those charged or still facing charges regarding January 6th and says he won't go after his political opponents like the outgoing President Biden um which is perhaps a sign to those that are worried about that that he's at least trying to seek some uh a more consiliary tone saying that if there's any retribution it'll come through the successes that he expects to have as president and Ed a lot of headlines there that you laid out he also said that he wanted to end Birthright citizenship through executive action let's take a listen to exactly [1253.32s] what he said if somebody sets a foot just a foot one foot you don't need to On Our Land congratulations you are now a a citizen of the United States of America yes we're going to end that because it's ridiculous through executive action well if we can through executive action all right so had the immediate question coming from that is can he actually do that no because it is an amendment to the Constitution and it would require another constitutional amendment to [1283.76s] reverse it so he also said he would take this potentially to the states which is plain English for try to get enough of them to reverse the amendment that allows for this and then uh potentially have it go away so that's a pretty tall order uh for him to suggest that he would want to do that through executive order you heard him say there we'll see that may have less to do with the idea that he believes he can do that but more just that it was brought up in his presence and he didn't have a good answer for it other than no I can't do that we'll see uh but immigration remains a big focus of his uh and we know that those preparing to serve with [1314.92s] him in the administration are making big plans for Mass de ations and what and he also suggested for example when asked about the potential for family separation that if there are children in this country whose parents need to be deported they can go with them that's repeating what Tom Holman his uh expected borders are has said which is and he said it to 60 minutes a few weeks ago that if there's families that have undocumented people in them the entire family can be sent back that will ultimately go to a court to be considered potentially all the way to the Supreme Court because if those [1345.56s] children are US citizens why would you be kicking them out of the country uh which of course is is is another Bedrock part of the immigration debate yeah some important context there um he he was also asked about his approach to abortion here's a little bit of that will you restrict the availability of abortion pills when you're in office uh probably I'll probably stay with exactly what I've been saying for the last two years and the answer is no you commit to that well I commit I mean are things do things change I think they [1377.16s] change I hate to go shows like Joe Biden I'm not going to give my son a pardon I will not under any circumstances give him a pardon I watch this and I always knew he was going to give him a Parton and so to I don't like putting myself in a position like that all right so Ed how how should we interpret that I think that was a bit of cya Caitlyn he understands the politics on this might shift and he'll he may face pressure from within his own party uh to to possibly restrict abortion more but for now as he's saying there leave it up [1409.00s] to the states to decide which was an answer that worked for him during the campaign as it kind of inoculated the issue that Democrats were trying to make over the course especially the last few weeks of the campaign yeah exactly um Edo Kee Thank you very much for your reporting we'll see you soon and Syria's political unrest is putting Tulsi gabbard's past into Focus coming up by Trump's

to drum up support as President elect Trump's pick for Director of National Intelligence the former congresswoman is also drawing renewed scrutiny for her 2017 visit to Syria to meet with Bashar al-assad who fled the nation yesterday after Rebel forces seized the Syrian Capital our Scott McFarland is on Capitol Hill for us tonight Scott good to see you uh so tell us a little bit about who gab gabard is meeting with on [1694.80s] the hill today and how is that trip to Syria and her comments about Assad playing are they impacting having any impact on her confirmation yeah Caitlyn she is following the path of some of the other nominees starting off with Trump's loyalists in the US Senate those who have unequivocally and consistently backed what Donald Trump says and what Donald Trump does so she met with senators from Oklahoma South Dakota and Iowa today no surprise there we pressed her as she walked down that hallway about her thoughts on Assad's fall in [1727.24s] Syria because of those allegations she is close to Assad or has supported Assad she walked past without answering when she came back out we asked her other questions and she answered in a way that didn't directly respond to the issue of Assad just saying that she supports what Donald Trump says about Syria and about Assad she will no doubt be asked these questions during these one-on-one meetings but Caitlyn the premise here Remains the Same whether it's the defense secretary nominee the FBI nominee or this intelligence nominee she is beginning with the political loow [1757.96s] hanging fruit the people who are always consistently supportive of Donald Trump and are likely to support most if not all of his nominees and making another appearance on Capitol Hill today is Cash Patel he's another one of Trump's more controversial picks but also a top loyalist of his um where does support for him stand at this point to be FBI director yeah he's auditioning for a job that doesn't have an opening right now the FBI director position is filled with a trump appointee Christopher Ray who is [1789.56s] to serve until 2027 now cash Patel before he even took a meeting today got a big boost of support Chuck Grassley the the incoming chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee who will oversee confirmation processes here issued a letter to Christopher Ray saying Ry should stand down that he's been disappointed in the FBI's performance which would open a door for cash Patel to get that job cash Patel also meeting though as the day concluded here with those Trump loyalists in the US Senate not a dissenting voice about cash Patel from [1820.44s] any of those he met with that would include John cornin of Texas who walked out of that meeting you're seeing on your screen and told me that at this point cash Patel appears to be ready for the job and that if the job is open there's no indication of opposition at least not yet to cash Patel but to be clear here cash Patel comes in with a lot of baggage for Democrats he was there perpetuating Donald Trump's baseless claims about the 2020 election made some provocative moves up the ladder in the final days of the first [1850.76s] Trump presidency Democrats are ready to question him saying that he is a loyalist to Donald Trump and will not be a loyalist to the FBI itself with the Department of Justice we'll see if that criticism gets anywhere but the day concluded here Caitlyn with no dissenting voices in the Republican party at least not outwardly about cash Patel that's interesting Scott I want to ship skars a little bit and talk about this interview that Trump did with NBC over the weekend um his first interview since his election um at least on television um he he talked about this [1880.92s] campaign promise to Pardon January 6th defendants I want to play a little of what he said look at everything we're going to look at individual cases yeah but I'm going to be uh acting very quickly within your first 100 days first day first day first day now Scott I know you've been covering these cases very closely where do they stand now and and what does that mean for those who have already been convicted there's a lot to unpack in what Donald Trump said about January 6 [1911.28s] yesterday and if you look into the subtext there's a lot of news there first of all that he'd move on the first day shows the urgency with which he is moving with something we're not sure is publicly popular there are 1500 plus January 6 defendants some of whom hundreds of whom are accused of assaulting police some of gassing police that day but what Trump also said to Meet the Press yesterday is that one of the rationals he's bringing to this is that those people in his words have been locked up for years in a bad place [1942.28s] references to jails or prisons those who've been locked up for years are not the misdemeanor defendants are those who were non-violent those who've been locked up for years and Fa the prospect of years more are those who assaulted police and if he is talking about pardoning those Topline defendants it would indicate he may be considering pardoning all of the January 6 defendants not some he's never specified if it's all or some and there could be any number of political ramifications to that choice Caitlyn but also any number of people would say if you pardon [1974.00s] everybody for a violent Insurrection you are just wedding the prospects of future political violence indeed well Scott McFarland thank you for covering it all for us tonight we appreciate it but we are going to get rid of Obamacare I will never stop one vote I will never stop what a difference eight years makes with Obamacare still here does the president-elect have a plan to take on Healthcare

Affairs of state with the Diplomat and In Praise of pigeons listen for the trumpet repeal and replace that 2016 message to overhaul the Affordable Care Act helped guide Donald Trump to the White House nevertheless when pressed on his health care policy over the weekend the president-elect was unable to give specifics about a path forward do you have an actual plan at this point for healthcare yes we have concepts of a [2222.52s] plan that would be better still just Concepts do you have a fully developed plan let me explain we are we have the biggest health care companies looking at it we have doctors we're always looking because Obamacare stinks let's bring in our political panel Joel Payne is a CBS News political contributor and a democratic strategist and Matt Gorman is a Republican strategist and served as a senior adviser on Senator Tim Scott's presidential campaign gentlemen great to see you both here um Matt I want to start with you because uh the [2254.92s] president-elect has a lot to do on day one do Republicans want to be talking about making changes like that to healthcare no I don't think Trump does either right he this was the same thing he fell into when he was like it the first time right they they felt like they had to do Obamacare first if you talk to the Trump team afterwards they wish they done either taxes or infrastructure first I think they're not going to fall in that same trap again um because again his whole first two years in the 2018 midterms were defined by Healthcare I think this is something he doesn't really want to do uh and I don't [2285.92s] expect him them to follow through on it I mean it seems like Democrats would invite that kind of conversation to be able to run against it yeah I mean but this is who Donald Trump is this is who Republicans are like you know it reminds me actually of uh after George Bush won reelection back in 2004 was a little bit of a bait and switch right he kind of ran on one thing and then decided to like go after Social Security and Medicare and I do think that if Donald Trump and Republicans try to go after something like the Affordable Care Act or if they do unpopular things they'll [2316.32s] be penalized for it again they have to read what the American people were telling them during the election the appropriate way if they read it as American people want us to go far to the right they want us to do a bunch of unpopular things they're going to have an unpopular presidency he has a choice if he doesn't want to do that and I think it'll be interesting to see how he chooses to govern if he chooses to govern and obviously another huge issue in this election was immigration There Was You Know broad I would say majority support in our polling for Mass deportation but Matt in that interview over the weekend Trump talked about [2347.12s] ending Birthright citizenship is that something that Republicans should entertain well there's even a question whether or he can do without a Constitutional Amendment which would be a lot of lift of political Capital right as you said there are immigration things he can get done both by executive order and through congressional action that are fairly popular and can be a relatively easy lift or at least go along with the popular opinion stream Birthright citizenship I mean I remember talking about this with Scott Walker when he ran for president in 2015 when I was on Jeb Bush's campaign that was an issue back then I think there there is a certainly I'm not sure if there's [2378.72s] political capital or the will among even the party to have a constitutional fight for Birthright citizenship there are other things he can do far more effective far more popular yeah I mean the the question of whether he can do it obviously is is kind of the most important one for for Democrats I mean are there incentives to work with this Administration on immigration issu or do they feel like they don't want to engage and that the president-elect can do things unilaterally I mean con Harris ran on Jim lanford's immigration bill I still think that that is essentially [2409.92s] Democrat starting point so I would see no reason why they wouldn't want to work together on that but you know what's interesting over that the the interview over the weekend the thing that I took from it was Donald Trump promis saying I can't promise that people's prices won't go up or that people won't see a hit to their bottom line when I'm president because of this crazy thing want to do it terrorists and we're talking about immigration here and I do think that um you know it's interesting when you're thinking about how Trump is going to govern here is he going to govern in a way that's actually going to negatively impact the lives of the American people like that is like it's easy to talk [2441.56s] about I want to do all these things in terms of mass deportations I want to do the this aggressive tariff policy but I mean gosh if I'm a republican I'd be concerned about people experiencing pain at the at their pocketbooks he's being handed a really strong economy I don't know if he wants to screw that up similar to how he did you know 8 years ago or four years ago in in 2016 I think if he was handed a strong economy it'd be president-elect Harris right now I I don't think it's is as strong as you say but I I will say this I think what he is setting the terms of the of the negotiation right he's extremely comfortable at negotiating table and as [2473.12s] we saw with how Trudeau and shin bomb both acted in when in relation to his tariff threat Trudeau immediately went down met face to face I think they start started off on a better foot I think Shin bomb boxed herself in with this kind of very chess stumping commit to she absolutely did it was a very antagonistic letter where Trudeau got face to face with him got in a room started a fight someone who agree to policy they already are are executing again I think what you wanted to do if you're Trudeau you want to get face to face and Trump wants to get the best deal possible like by kind of starting [2504.92s] off in a bad foot and by having house Democrats align with her it starts her in a bad foot as well in terms of negotiation with this so there is this uh question of you know Trump being kind of handed a mandate to talk about address these issues that you're talking about the economy immigration but at the same time he's also talking about things like pardoning January 6th um uh defendants um is that a conversation that should be had among Republicans um I mean it was [2535.44s] talked about a lot on the campaign Trail I think two things can be true number one I think he's far more effective in going in on immigration and the economy I think that and and I think also if you're talking about 2020 I said this about Democrats and Republicans nowadays you're losing however I will say this in light of the hunter Biden Parton it's a lot easier to make those sorts of arguments because the Norms in a lot of respects we're talk we had the hunter Biden pardon for crimes he wasn't even convicted of we're talking about preemptive pardons currently before Biden leaves office it makes it so much more palatable not among Republicans but also in terms of norms to start now [2566.72s] partying janary IE I agree on both points I agree that if you're talking about the past you're losing and I would advise Trump and his team to consider that I would also say too again it's a matter of priorities if you've told the American people I'm going to be focused on your problems the things that matter to you making your life easier and then you spend time political retribution coming right off the off the bat that's not going to send a good message starting um a second Trump presidency right less than two months to go before inauguration and day one plenty to talk about until then as [2597.76s] well thank you both for being here we appreciate it as many syrians celebrate the end of the Assad regime there are new hopes for missing American journalists Austin Ty next his brother and sister join us with more on

stronger and wealthier this is a war but we're not fighting it our citizens are dying funding cartels now streaming on the free CBS News app you're mindful that there Americans in Syria including those who reside there as well as Austin Ty [2817.36s] who was taking captive more than 12 years ago we remain committed to returning him to his family and that was President Biden speaking about missing journalist Austin Ty Ty was working as a freelance journalist in Syria in 2012 when he disappeared outside of Damascus he worked for several news outlets including CBS News Ty's fam Ty's family believes that he is still alive and in in in Syrian hands the Assad regime claimed it was not holding Ty and had no [2847.80s] further information about his whereabouts well two of Austin's siblings join us now Naomi and Jonathan Ty thank you so much for being here we appreciate you being here thank you so much for having us as we heard from the president he believes that your brother is still alive your family does as well I'm wondering what information you have that you can share um to give you that kind of Hope yeah absolutely so President Joe Biden has consistently said that Austin is alive and recently [2878.76s] we were able to independently verify that with another source um and so we have full confidence that Austin is indeed alive that he is in s Syria and that he is absolutely waiting to walk free and the News over the weekend of what happened in Syria how do you think that impacts your brother's condition um and anything that you know it really changes the dynamic and it changes what's happening in this moment uh it's a really unique moment over the course of the last 12 years that we've been advocating to bring him [2910.08s] home um one of the things that we truly believe is is in chaos there is opportunity uh so this is the moment to reach out to any and all organizations or individuals uh to do anything in their power uh anything they can do to help us bring him home and in your conversations that you and your family have had with the administration so far um are you confident that they can at least locate where he is yeah it has been very frustrating as we've been interacting um there is a lot [2942.88s] of uncertainty obviously just generally in the moment um but we are really asking the current Administration President Joe Biden to do everything he can as well as the incoming Administration president-elect Donald Trump we know that there are tools that they have available to them to bring Austin home and so we are really asking that they use all of them and anything specific that you would like to hear or for people to do right now on the ground we do have in Syria we have had a campaign of uh information going out to [2975.28s] the Syrian people uh informing them letting them know and making sure they're aware of Austin's uh situation and so right now what we want is for that information to get into the right hands the right person the right moment who can assist in bringing him home and Jonathan he's been in captivity since 2012 as we just said um what do you know about his time there and what do you want people to know there's not a lot of information uh out there about the specifics of his time there uh what [3006.92s] we do know is that he is in Syria uh we know that he has been in Damascus um and we do know that he is one he is well taken care of that he is um healthy alive and ready to be home and Naomi what do you want people to know about your brother I mean I think Austin went over there with the purpose of sharing the story of the Syrian people at that moment in 2012 um he went there with amazing conviction about the importance of Journalism of sharing news and I I [3039.04s] just want people to understand that like this is um this is such an amazing man who has done so much for for our family but also for the country as a marine ve veteran and and I really believe that it's our duty to bring him home just the the internal strength that he has and like Naomi was saying his conviction and his desire to do good and do right and to see more right and good in the world uh growing up he was always that pillar of integrity and so it's as an American as a as a former Marine as a journalist [3070.12s] it's always been his goal to shed light and dark and to make sure that uh good prevails and so that's really the most important thing to know about him is just that intrinsic goodness and he is he's a treasure to the country he's a treasure to our family and there's a huge hole uh every every life event that happens with that he's not there yeah and and to the extent that you're comfortable sharing what has this been like for your family yeah I mean it's been extraordinarily challenging we're a very very close-knit family um and there [3101.60s] seven of you there's seven of us yes and and and you know all all of us siblings are are here in DC we've always been so committed to do anything you know as soon as we can for Austin because there is like John mentioned a huge hole in our family with without him with us um and so it it it's just been very challenging we do have uh since since he's been detained um we've had five different uh nieces and nephews as H be born um I've gotten married my sister [3131.64s] has gotten married as well um there's just so many life events that we wish that he had been here for yeah of course um and you know as he's been gone there have been several administrations as you mentioned a new one coming in um I'm I'm wondering you know you said that you were here for uh to to Advocate and Lobby and then of course the news over the weekend I wonder what was going through your mind what was kind of the first thing in your mind when you heard um that Assad",

was um pushed out of [3163.68s] power I think really just recognizing that this is an opportunity that this is something that is different than what has happened over the last 12 years this is a chance for President Joe Biden and president-elect Donald Trump to to do something different and and to show that they are capable of bringing Austin home we know that they are and we just really hope that they utilize this opportunity we've absolutely seen uh the footage of detainees being released across Syria and return to their families and we're just really hopeful [3196.24s] that that's going to be our story here well we uh hope that is your story as well Naomi and Jonathan thank you so much we're thinking of your family and wishing you all the best and good news to come thank you for

[3414.08s] listen to 60 Minutes a second look where wherever you get your podcasts and welcome back to America decides Democratic Governors are preparing for what could come from president-elect Trump's second term several of them attended a conference in Los Angeles over the weekend and they're planning to they're planning on which fights to pick with Trump and where there could be compromised Ain Navaro joins us now and Aaron good to see you I know you were at this conference reporting on it um what were the governors talking about in terms of ways [3445.92s] that they could fight back against this incoming Administration I think the clearest thing that they pointed to was Trump's talk of mass deportations while Governors did say if they had federal assistance to help with uh undocumented migrants that have violent uh offenses or are convicted criminals they would welcome that they think his broad plan to deport all um undocumented immigrants they would fight back against that I was talking to New Mexico Governor Michelle Luhan Grisham of course a border state she talked about how wouldn't allow her [3476.80s] State Police to comply wouldn't permit licenses for detention buildings for anyone that's found to be held and uh wouldn't give private information to the federal government saying that it is unconstitutional with State and uh the US Constitution um but as they talked about ways that they would fight back against Trump they were uh cognizant of not seeming too much like a fullon resistance they did invite some areas uh to find compromise with them yeah I'm curious what that would be because they're also [3508.32s] governors of States I mean there're going to have to be ways that they work with this Administration whether they like it or not did you see any areas of compromise and they admit that they're still waiting to see what comes down the road with this you know next Trump term uh there was talk of reducing personal costs financially so anything in regards to the economy they would take a look at working with Trump on though they are a bit weary of potential tariffs um I know Laura uh Kelly the Governor from Kansas talked about um red in or at least looking at federal agencies and the size [3539.20s] of them um that of course is something that Elon Musk and V Ram Swami have been looking at uh though she said she may be questions if they should be the ones leading that effort that's interesting too because Kelly and others are governors of red States even though they're Democrats um when you look to conferences like these and Gatherings like these you're kind of always wondering who among them might emerge as potentially candidates in 2028 I know that's so far from now but I'm wondering from your reporting what you've gathered about you know whether there are any kind kinds of you know leaders that [3569.48s] might come from the Democratic uh Governors and also you know what their prescriptions were for what happened I got the sense that they're still dissecting what happened in 2024 uh just from talking to Governors and also strategists and lobbyists that were there they do look to the 2025 elections in New Jersey and Virginia the over 30 governor elections in 2026 as a way to help build the party uh maybe add or flip States add people to kind of the leaders of the democratic party but [3600.08s] certainly uh just from talking to people not necessarily the governors who wouldn't necessarily touch this but people at the conference there are lanes that the 2028 candidate can have one that was really uh the big opposer to Trump uh one that found compromise so that's going to be something that will impact how these Governors act in the next four years yeah kind of look at those dividing Lines within the party uh Aon Naro thank you very much good to see you and that does it for us today will be back with another edition of America decides tomorrow at 5:00 p.m",

                  "content": "the mail matched the description of the United healthc Care um murder everyone we're beginning with breaking news I'm lindsy Davis thanks so much for joining us we go now to this live press conference in Altuna Pennsylvania where they have uh apprehended a person of interest connected with the shooting of the United Health CEO gunned down in New York City last week let's take a listen shooting uh recent days that mail was asked for a form of identification he then provided a fake [33.24s] identification card out of New Jersey after a brief investigation it was determined that the ID provided was in fact a fake ID and he was subsequently arrested uh for a forgery charge once he was taken into custody for that forgery charge he was transported to the altina police department once at the altina police department that mail was searched instant to arrest it was discovered uh they had a you uh a United States [65.36s] passport that identified him as excuse me Luigi mangion from there continued search of his property a firearm was located and a suppressor was also located there were also other items of evidentiary value that were located uh that would assist in this investigation at this time I'm going to [96.16s] turn it over to Governor Shapiro for some words thank you deputy chief Swope and let me acknowledge and thank the law enforcement who I'm joined with today beginning with Lieutenant Colonel Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police I want to thank senior special supervisory agent Zabo from the FBI and acknowledge NYPD commissioner doy and the women and [129.48s] men of the NYPD who join us here today district attorney weeks who you will hear from shortly and I just concluded a briefing with mayor Adams and commissioner Tish from New York I want to begin by thanking our fellow Pennsylvania resident who acted as hero today Pennsylvania resident saw something early this morning at McDonald's and said something to our local police and our local police here [161.72s] in Altuna acted swiftly I want to say a special thanks to officer Tyler fry of the Altuna Police Department Officer fry is about six months into his time serving his fellow people here in Pennsylvania and he acted swiftly he acted with smarts and he acted with calm you know safety often turns on the strength of the relationship between the community and law enforcement we have [193.76s] that strong relationship here in Altuna and it was proven here today I want to ask all of our fellow pennsylvanians to demonstrate the same type of thoughtfulness and courage and smarts as the individual MD Donald's did this morning and help law enforcement here in Pennsylvania as we continue with our investigation you'll see photos of the suspect who is here and you should know that this suspect traveled between [225.28s] Philadelphia and Pittsburgh making stops in between obviously here in Altuna I want to ask all of our fellow pennsylvanians to help us with any tips that they might have by contacting us at 8004 PA tips again that number is 8004 PA tips the suspect was just arranged arraigned here in the courthouse and [255.40s] presumably New York will file charges very very soon that process will continue to play out and Justice will be delivered in this case this case has hinged on on attention in fact the attention in this case and the killing of Brian Thompson was helpful no doubt in allowing us to capture this killer in alerting that individual at McDonald's [285.44s] this morning and then having that individual contact police but some attention in this case especially online has been deeply disturbing as some have looked to celebrate instead of condemning this killer Brian Thompson was a father to two he was a husband and he was a friend to many and yes he was the CEO of a health insurance company in [317.44s] America we do not kill people in Cold Blood to resolve policy differences or Express a Viewpoint I understand people have real frustration with our Health Care system and I have worked to address that throughout my career but I have no tolerance nor should anyone for one man using an illegal ghost gun to murder someone because he [350.32s] thinks his opinion matters most in a civil society we are all less safe when ideologues engage in vigilante justice in some dark Corners this killer is being hailed as a hero hear me on this he is no hero the real hero in this story is the person who called 911 at McDonald's this morning the real heroes [382.64s] every day in our society are the women and men who put on uniforms like these and go out in our communities to keep us safe this killer was not a hero he should not be hailed Mr Thompson I understand was laid to rest earlier today in Minnesota in a private setting as the conversation continues about this case let's be mindful not to dehumanize [414.16s] him and make him just an avatar of a system that is dis liked by many he was a father he was a husband and he did not deserve to die like this on the sidewalk in New York City I again want to thank all law enforcement who's present here this evening law enforcement works best when it works together in this case you have the New York Police Department working together with the Altuna Police [444.68s] Department working together with our Pennsylvania State Police and our partners at the Federal level as well everyone came together to solve this case and keep the public safe I again want to ask my fellow pennsylvanians if you have any information regarding this suspect or his travels throughout Pennsylvania please share those tips with us immediately and with that I want to thank district attorney weeks for his [476.04s] important work today and invite him to the microphone to say a few words thank you Governor Shapiro good evening everyone I would Echo the governor's sentiments law enforcement does work at its best when they work together I'd also like to uh thank district attorney cidal he and his staff came down from the Manhattan District Attorney's office today in record time uh to assist us at the Aluna police department and as the governor stated uh the state police the Aluna [508.40s] Police Department the the FBI the New York City Police Department Logan Township Police Department the Blair County Sheriff's Department um and other agencies all work together today um to do what needed to be done uh to seek Justice I would uh and I often brag about how the community in Blair County uh isn't afraid to say something uh to report a crime to contact local law enforcement and I've often touted how [539.68s] they've made their Community whether it be Altuna or somewhere else a safer place to live and today I submit that a resident from Aluna and the Aluna Police Department helped make New York City a safer place to live and helped the Kickstart the process to seek Justice uh for a senseless killing so again I'd like to thank everybody and it's my honor to introduce Deputy Commissioner daughtery at this time thank you thank you Mr a on behalf of the uh [572.48s] New York city mayor Eric Adams my boss Police Commissioner Jessica Tish wants to extend once again their appreciation to the Aluna Police Department to your to your your your leadership team federals State local authorities and especially to the customer at the McDonald's that seen something says something to the McDonald's employee that called 911 and reported this individual inside [603.84s] of their uh restaurant the men and women behind me the detectives some of these detectives that stated behind me haven't been home since Tuesday when this incident happened they've been working this case tirelessly around the clock and when they got that phone call immediately they jumped in their car to the police car and race down here to go see if this is the individual they were looking for that's dedication that that's commit that their [634.28s] commitment to bringing this individual to justice is just standing behind me and on behalf of the mayor and the police commissioner they extend their uh their thanks and appreciation to you as well this here's a message to the criminal element that think they that they want to commit a crime in New York City and cross state lines county lines the message is very clear Police Commissioner tish's police department [664.44s] will find you and bring you to Justice just look behind me thank youse I think with that uh we'll be happy to try and take a few questions question I guess maybe for the local about the arrest specifically today um how we'll defer to Al tuna please I guess I'm I'm curious if we could hear a little bit more about the Dynamics you [696.36s] could set the Pod could hear a little bit more about the Dynamics inside that McDonald's I know there was some detail in the after about what happened when the individual was asked to be New York could you speak a little bit to his demeanor and and how that played out sure so it was a peaceful arrest first and foremost um the officer quickly recognized uh the male as the suspect from the shooting and within several minutes seconds of the first Contact he had [726.96s] asked um the suspect if he had been in New York City recently and that really invoked a physical reaction from the suspect he became visibly nervous uh kind of shaking um at that question and he didn't really answer it directly so that that statement alone really really said a lot and he the suspect didn't have to say a lot after that question to to show that you know he he was very nervous at that point was that the officer that that the governor mentioned [759.12s] doing the job who was involved in that yes so officer fry here to my left um officer fry you steep this way a little bit and then his partner that he was with officer Joe deweer officer you I mean could you maybe identify yourself and be describ that whole interaction what out spell your name uh yeah patrolman fry uh y",

asked to be New York could you speak a little bit to his demeanor and and how that played out sure so it was a peaceful arrest first and foremost um the officer quickly recognized uh the male as the suspect from the shooting and within several minutes seconds of the first Contact he had [726.96s] asked um the suspect if he had been in New York City recently and that really invoked a physical reaction from the suspect he became visibly nervous uh kind of shaking um at that question and he didn't really answer it directly so that that statement alone really really said a lot and he the

yourself and be describ that whole interaction what out spell your name uh yeah patrolman fry uh y l e r f r y uh so whenever we got on scene there uh we we were able to pretty much find where he was at in the in the restaurant [790.44s] uh and as soon as he pulled he was wearing a blue medical mask as soon as we pulled that down or we asked him to pull it down uh we me my partner and I recognized him immediately just from what we saw in the media with photos videos um we we just didn't even think twice about it we knew that was our guy but he was very uh he was very Cooperative with us didn't really give us too many issues uh once we found out his identity we we took it from there I do feel six months [823.52s] on the job as a law en I I I can't say I was expecting it uh by any means but it it feels good to get a guy like that off the street uh especially starting my career this way it's it feels great so arrest has he made any St since his arrest has he asked for a lawyer yet to my knowledge he hasn't made any statements how long is he staying in Aluna and where was he staying and then was the gun on himself or was it in like a car somewhere we are still investigating how long he's been in Altuna uh there's still a lot of [854.04s] follow up to do in this case again the the men and women behind me are assisting with that um so we're still looking into it I'm going to ask um Lieutenant Colonel Biven of the Pennsylvania State Police to address the question he just raised thank you yes so there are uh a lot of things that need to be followed up yet uh in this investigation certainly there were a number of items that were found on his person in his backpack that have been inventoried uh and we've begun to do an analysis of some of those there were written documents um there are [887.16s] electronic devices that are in the process of being downloaded um search warant are are obtained and so over the the next uh uh hours and days those um efforts will continue and we're going to take a closer look at all of the information that we can glean from that regarding his activities up until and during the time of the homicide his flight from New York and we know that he has been in Pennsylvania excuse me for several days and so part of that [918.36s] investigation will also focus on trying to retrace his steps we've already identified businesses for example that he frequented in this area and activities that he engaged in that led us to more evidence and so all of that is becoming kind of a mountain of evidence that has to be analyzed and and looked at uh I'm confident we'll have a much better idea of his activities um over the past you know number of days uh in New York and in Pennsylvania additionally we're also trying to [948.96s] determine um that we don't have another actor or an accomplice out there and so this information will be used to help us prove or disprove uh whether that exists and whether there were any other intended targets so a lot of questions that are out there that are unanswered yet but we have a lot of information that we can examine that hopefully will give us some of those uh uh those pieces of of data that we need uh you asked or someone asked about the U the interview [980.00s] uh he was initially Cooperative he is not now um and so um he has been arraigned and transported and will be securely housed uh pending the filing of additional charges in New York you mentioned that he was in Pittsburgh at some point is that correct what do you know about that time in Pittsburgh we're not going to get into any more details at this time we would like to hear from any Pennsylvanian um or any pittsburger who had any sightings [1011.32s] or any dealings with the individual that's why I specifically asked for anyone with tips to share that with us addition to New York that process work I know that you have your piece here but what happens Within yor part and how long does it take thank you so that answer depends a once the charging documents are filed in the state of New York we will file a fugitive Justice complaint against the defendant he'll be brought uh before a common police judge [1042.28s] uh shortly thereafter and the defendant will be presented with the option to wave his extradition or to contest his extradition if he waves his extradition we of course will make him available uh to NYPD in the Manhattan District Attorney's office as soon as you know we're able to arrange his Transportation there if he contest it that process typically takes between 30 and 45 days uh to do the requisite paperwork but we do that all the time um in our office [1072.36s] and that's kind of a normal procedure the matter of on the matter of the backpack itself right now the backpack you had the one that was in New York do we know if that's the same one that he had the time of the shooting there or is this backpack that he had here and one that he may have Acquired and the findings inside the gun the silencer and cash some porn currency as well is that correct I'll defer to someone else I'm not going to speculate on any of the interpretation of the evidence I'm going to rely on the officers doing the investigation to complete that and reach [1103.20s] their conclusions at this point he is a suspect the hit on the United CEO can we call him a suspect at this point obviously on yes as we confirmed at his preliminary arraignment um with the uh permission of district attorney cidal we expect charges to be filed forth with um and obviously you that I'm not going to speculate on that timing but tonight or tomorrow or sometime in the very near future for [1136.76s] homicide in the off place can you say any more about a suspected possible notive so uh at this point we're not going to comment on that I mentioned that there is a lot of information to go through certainly everything has been or will be shared with NYPD but there is other information that um really doesn't even pertain to that um investigation that again focuses more on his activities here in Pennsylvania and other travels so all of that hopefully uh will shine more light on it there is [1167.36s] some information that uh gives us some insight into his thinking but again all part of the ongoing investigation and way too early to discuss that as far as uh as far as the NYPD we're not going to be commenting on the investigation steps uh here and the next couple of days there'll be a media availability at One Police Plaza and commissioner Tish will update uh commissioner Tish and the chief of detectives Joe keny will update the meteor at One Police Plaza but I will be happy to talk about that the uh commissioner tishan the New York city [1197.72s] mayor did Face Time officer fry um and then uh thank them for their service so that was uh he got a pretty cool phone call from the mayor and our police commissioner do we know how he got to Pennsylvania was through aircraft train bus how did he arrive in Pennsylvania again we do have a good idea of that but uh all part of the ongoing investigation just to clarify Governor you you had suggested I think I heard you I want to make sure I heard it right that that he I guess he took a bus from the terminal the Dr washing bridge to Philly and then [1229.04s] from there he was around the stage around up here or is that your can you be any more specific about where you how you think this works well again I'll I'll jump in as it's all part of the ongoing investigation and so yes we do have a good idea how he got from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh uh but there are some gaps in time and so before we start laying out uh a timeline of his travel we really need to work through all of that and and so we know that at some point it is likely he was in a variety of locations across the state to [1261.40s] include Philadelphia Pittsburgh and points in between and then Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and way back again that will all be part of the uh logically he's caught here in Altuna so logically he was in those locations first but again the timeline of all of that will be part",

again the timeline of all of that will be part of the ongoing investigation several days obviously he was caught at McDonald's this morning guy got to eat for the past few days he's been on the Run for multiple days at this point how did he manage to evade [1291.48s] detection for so long so I think uh again as part of the ongoing investigation when we determine where he's been where he stayed those kinds of things we may be able to answer some of those questions um but uh but right now I will tell you that um based on everything that we have seen he was very careful with um trying to stay low profile uh avoid cameras uh not all that successfully in some cases but uh but that was certainly the effort he was making he took steps to try and uh you [1323.44s] know um avoid detection with some of the electronic devices and things as well so again all part of the investigation but uh but clearly um you know somebody that was very security conscious and and trying to avoid somebody no criminal record and this was a name that was not previously known to law enforcement uh I am not aware of a criminal history on this IND evasion devices it was mentioned in the hearing and then the defendant said that those were waterpr bags could you speak [1355.12s] a little bit more to what was taken into evidence today uh no not at this point again I've spoken generally about what's there but uh um at this point everything uh remains under investigation and we'll have much more information and New York uh will certainly have information for you in the future how confident are you the suspect is there still a search for any other suspects other than the accomplice or potential accomplice we uh we're still going to Canvas we're still going to we're still going to [1385.84s] investigate um like I said before we're we're going to provide an update in a couple of days by the police commissioner and the chief of detectives back at New York I will say this though if anybody out there that has any information that they think that will help this case to please contact our tip line which is800 577 tips and remember all calls are kept confidential just by the uh the customer spoke with the employee the employee 4 911 yes that's right that is my [1419.12s] understanding yes sir was it a customer that recognized the suspect first hold employee and the employee rang police is that correct the employee record yes my uh my understanding I was just confirming but my understanding is the employee became suspicious thought they recognized and wanted someone to check it out further someone refer to a customer yes that's I'm saying the I'm sorry did I say the employee the customer uh recognized notified an employee and wanted someone to check it out further can you confirm which restaurant it was was it the one on [1449.48s] Plank Road uh I'm not uh I'm not familiar with the address of that it's a McDonald's but is that it yes they tell me it is the suspect disputed the currency can you explain why they're discrepancy or how much he was found to have again we're not going to talk about what was found in the uh in the bag we have accurately cataloged everything that was was in there and that'll be a matter for the future da weeks could you repeat what you said in court about that [1482.96s] money I certainly stand by all the comments I made at the preliminary arraignment but I'm not going to comment anymore in the evidence at this time my comments at preliminary arraignment were in support of my argument for bail thank you we probably have time for one or two more questions see being held at a county or state facility he will likely be taken to a State Correctional Institution later this evening I you say specifically for Pennsylvania law enforcement over the past few months you've had attempted assassination of a former president now [1515.72s] president now you had this what do you think about that violence can never be used to address political differences or to address a substantive difference or to try and prove some ideological point that is not what we do in a civilized society that was true in Butler it was true in New York City and [1547.88s] it's true anywhere that is not how you make progress in this country the person the suspect here who shot at that CEO killed that CEO is a coward not a hero and we need to make sure that in this country we get back to having a civil discourse about our differences and that is an important lesson coming out of Pennsylvania and it is one that I think the rest of the nation needs to hear as well on a law enforcement side I will [1579.76s] tell you that I am incredibly proud of the Pennsylvania State Police and local police in Butler and here in Altuna who responded in a way that kept others safe and saved other lives that was true at the fairgrounds in Butler and it was true here today in Altuna had that local Pennsylvanian not spoken up had that wonderful police officer who's been on this job for six months not acted calmly [1610.40s] and swiftly God knows what could have happened so I think the lessons coming out of Pennsylvania are that violence is not a way to answer questions and address problems and that we have the gift of law enforcement here in this Common Wealth who care deeply about the safety and well-being of our fellow pennsylvanians and our fellow Americans I commend them for that thank you all good evening everyone I'm lindsy [1641.16s] Davis thank you so much for streaming with us on this very busy Newsday of course we were just finishing hearing an update on the person of interest was taken into custody in the healthcare CEO shooting here in New York City United Health CEO Brian Thompson was gunned down last week while walking to a New York City hotel the suspect's photo circulated on social media igniting conversation and gaining the attention of people around the world police just told us more about their Person of Interest under arrest at already Say 26-year-old Luigi Manion of Maryland was [1672.40s] tracked down in Pennsylvania on unrelated gun charges after a tip was called in by a McDonald's worker who SP otted him eating police say mangion had a ghost gun with a suppressor like the one used in the Brazen attack and that he also had several fake IDs and a passport they say that the suspect made stops throughout Pennsylvania between Philadelphia Pittsburgh and also Altuna among those who spoke with the press conference just now Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro who hailed the person at McDonald's who spotted him and then called police a hero ABC's senior investigative correspondent Aaron kerki [1704.00s] joins us now from Altuna Pennsylvania and Aaron let's just go through the latest details as far as what they revealed about future charges for the death of the United Healthcare CEO those charges are pending they have not been filed yet but you heard the local authorities here in Altuna say they do expect that Luigi Manon will be charged for the murder of Brian Thompson in New York he was tracked here thanks to a heads up employee at a local [1734.60s] McDonald's and when he was there and police approached he initially according to the charging documents presented a fake New Jersey ID we actually have a a picture of it that we obtained here at ABC News and that ID was given to the police officers who really reminded him according to the charging document that that lying about your identity uh could be grounds for arrest and when the officer probed further asking have you ever been to New York City that's when they said menion uh had a physical [1767.00s] reaction he started shaking the charging documents said and that's when police here became confident they had the person that New York City Police had been looking for for the last 6 days Lindsay and they also spoke about some of the evidence including details on electronic devices what did we learn about that well they they know that they uh have a computer that they took they he was wearing the clothing that he was seen in some of the surveillance images from New York that that black hoodie or vest uh that is is what he was wearing [1799.48s] and we have a picture of him from inside the Altuna Police Department that shows that uh they also said that he had a a ghost gun very similar to the one that was used in the murder of Brian Thompson so",

that he had a a ghost gun very similar to the one that was used in the murder of Brian Thompson so at this point the authorities are confident he is the the suspect that they've been looking for uh and until now until this employee at McDonald's actually recognized him from the surveillance images that had been so widely circulated the authorities in New York did not have [1831.80s] his name so they are really taking pains to credit the idea of seeing something saying something which this individual did and Erin as you well know this case certainly got a lot of public interest and many controversial comments on social media Governor Shapiro felt that it was important to address that multiple times tonight I I thought that was one of the more striking uh things that that the governor said where where he he fully recognized the frustration that many Americans have with the health insurance [1863.60s] industry but he said we are all less safe when an ideologue engages in vigilantism and and he suggested that's that's what this murder of Brian Thompson was so he condemned the actions uh of of the Killer and said he's no hero and should not be hailed mindful that online the killing of Brian Thompson has engendered uh some sarcasm some celebration some viciousness such that United Healthcare over the weekend [1894.04s] put a fence around its headquarters in Minnesota and other health insurance companies sent their workers home told them to work from home for the foreseeable future Aaron kki we thank you so much for your reporting on this from day one and now I want to bring in ABC News contributor and former NYPD chief of detectives Bob boy thank you for for coming on and joining us tonight officials just presented as you heard some new evidence and we already knew about the ghost gun the handwritten document the fake IDs the social media posts and so on what profile is emerging [1925.20s] for you about manani well we now we have the chance to look into motivation now and we go to his online like we always do social media and see what he's saying to the rest the rest of the nation for that matter and we see a very troubled individual A Gifted young man who seems to have radicalized towards an anarchist type of behavior and aligns himself with Ted Kinski unibomber which was very surprising so now we see what's rooted here someone who was just such an impressive young man turned to this and that's where the motive comes here right now the anti-corporate the greed and all [1956.80s] those things made me suggest exactly why he wrote that on the showc casings and also the Monopoly money that we recovered that that police recovered from the backpack very interesting case it really is and very very scary for America right now anybody who supports this man officials talked about trying to retrace his footsteps partially through Electronics how will that help them to rebuild this case okay so right now we have him leaving New York it's tight time time frame he leaves within 45 minutes after the murder he goes up and shoots a man in the back and then runs away and then we [1987.76s] have him getting on a bike going through Central Park leaving the park and then making his way to a bus station that bus station right there up in the George Washington Bridge has the this Greyhound bus has three routes it's Boston DC and Philly he looks like he takes the Philly route and then it goes from Philly to Pittsburgh as the state trooper said so his routs are being covered right now and that'll be firmed up as we go forward he's on the run for five days we got to figure out where he was in those days exactly where he was doing where he St mangion has only been arrested on [2019.08s] unrelated charges right now but homicide charges are expecting what can we expect to happen next and and how long do you think that might take it it'll take very quickly in New York you're going to get arrest warrant for for a murder from them uh from the DA's office go for a judge and then shoot that up to Pennsylvania the hard part is that he accepts extra ition or not if he does then he'll be taken back to New York immediately if not you heard the da up there say 30 to 45 days and they'll be held in a penssylvania state penitentiary New York authorities said [2049.96s] that this is now the third time in three weeks that the public has helped catch a suspect in New York City how does the power of the people change law enforcement tactics I will tell you Lindsay um I was cheap at the Texas for four years I did 34 35 years in the police department it's a game changer it really is because you commit a crime of we're going to catch you at some point on video and that optic that they got at the at the hospital which led them to the hospital the hostel that picture right there we pulled his mask down that was golden for the nyp day to find that the other stuff [2080.40s] now this man has very distinctive eyebrows you can really see the exactly what what was behind that vest on top of that vest a partial and it and those officers said they recognized him immediately as soon as he pulled it down and the McDonald's was key also we don't always give out in the police department or any any law enforcement all the information that we have so we call it we call it qualifying information we never put out his name that the bogus name to use which was Mark Rosario the when detectives were called about this once they said it's [2110.60s] Mark Rosario you know you have your man right there so into the cars up to Aluna and that's where they are right now ABC News contributor and former NYPD chief of detectives Bob boy so thank you so much for your Insight Excell now to the verdict in the subway Chokehold trial here in New York

let's bring in Jordan ne's father Andre Zachary and his attorney Dante Mills thank you both so much for joining us on what we know is a very [2235.96s] difficult day uh Mr Zachary let's start with you uh obviously you were visibly angry in court today just what went through your mind what were you feeling when you heard that not guilty verdict um it hurt me very hurt um I just didn't know what to say at the time but um it hurt me to my core you know I hear something like that was there any time that you thought this [2267.60s] might be the outcome I mean it shouldn't be no surprise but here we are you you said the system is rigged what did what did you mean by that and how would I mean it's been like that for a long time and that the system could be R the way it is and what do you mean by that racially um it can be in many ways different ways but I'm not going to say racially right now but it could be in a [2297.68s] lot of ways and we don't want to make this this isn't a black or white issue this is about everybody mattering um there's some people who look at this and say Jordan was houseless he had mental issues almost as if he deserved this to happen to him uh and there's no qualms we all have problems and even with Andre there were times where he could have been there more for Jordan that that's understandable but it doesn't mean that Jordan deserved what happened to him or that you can simply choke someone to [2329.48s] death and not be held responsible for it that's what we want people to understand this isn't a white or black thing this is all of us we all have that right um to voice when we are feeling something to be heard um and for someone to be held accountable if they harm us when they shouldn't you said earlier today that you sought out and told the family you were going to get Justice now you're going to go seek it through the Civil cour Court which you just started uh last week the civil suit uh give us a sense of of the timing on that and and [2360.80s] if you think you might find Justice there we will I'm telling you we will uh the timing is we started the lawsuit not right away we wanted to see what the evidence was what the defense was going to be and when we heard in court all of the evidence where uh the incident was over after 30 seconds so whether or not Daniel peny was right in acting to begin with the entire incident was over in 30 seconds everybody was off the train and Daniel Penney continued to choke him for up to six minutes when people were [2392.28s] saying let him go you're going to kill him let his hand we have his hands let his neck go you're going to kill him once we heard all of that that's when we began the Civil process and filed that lawsuit it's going to take some time it could be a year or two but we're not going to stop until we do have Justice because that's what our system calls for we're not in Rebellion right now we're following the rules of our legal system if you think somebody killed someone uh and they should not have we have the right to file a wrongful death suit and that's what we did from a legal standpoint what aspect of this do you [2423.64s] feel that the jury didn't take into account that Jordan was a person person that's the only way that you can see this situation and say uh that he did not deserve the justice that we were seeking on the criminal side is if you don't think he was valuable enough to do it he the only way you can say that is Jordan was scary he came on he scared some people on the train that could be true but at some point you have to be a human and have humanity and say Daniel Penney could have let go before Jordan [2456.36s] died he to choke him 50 seconds after he was lifeless he continued to choke him there's no there's no reason for that and there's no reason for a jury to say that that's not criminal uh Behavior it is Mr Zachary tell us about your son what you miss most about him well I miss his voice I miss being around him I miss him dancing if you could talk to Daniel Penny directly what would you say why [2487.80s] you didn't say you were sorry man come on man why you didn't say nothing would that have mattered it sure would have well Mr Zachary uh I'm sure it's not the same but we do want to say we're sorry for the loss of your son and we thank you both so much for for taking the time to to come on and talk with us today thank you thank you joining us now is legal analyst Terry Austin Terry thank you for coming on you were inside the courtroom when the verdict was read tell us what it was like to witness such mixed reaction in [2518.80s] what's been an extremely polarizing case Lindsay I've never seen anything quite like that as soon as the jury foreperson read the verdict and said not guilty the audience half of them applauded and the other half was screaming and as a matter of fact you did hear people scream out you heard explicativ you actually heard someone who was crying so the judge basically said no more noise and she did say to take Jordan ne's father out [2549.64s] because his Outburst continued and because he was cursing so the guards did take him out but it was something that I've not seen I've seen many many verdicts and I have not seen a verdict where the entire audience broke out manslaughter was dismissed Friday what do you think was the biggest sticking point for jurors in their decision not to convict Penny it's interesting because based on their questions I think they had trouble with justification whether or not this was reasonable under the circumstances and [2580.60s] that justification applied to both the manslaughter and the criminally negligent homicide so I must say I was a little bit surprised when they came back with a not guilty verdict they must have over the weekend relaxed not thought about the case and then come in this morning fresh and obviously some of those in that room convince the others that there was no criminal negligence here and so you see a verdict of not Gilly I think they thought to themselves what Daniel Penny did was reasonable [2613.48s] under the circumstances and so they found him not guilty the attorney for ne's father is of course hoping for justice in their civil suit against Penny uh do you think that there will be a different outcome in Civil Court compared to Criminal Court I know Dante Mills and he's an excellent lawyer and there could be a very different outcome in the civil suit there's a lesser standard obviously there's not that standard of Beyond Reasonable Doubt and he could very well be able to establish that this was wrongdoing he filed an [2643.52s] action for a wrongful death and under the standards of the law he very well could get a verdict in his favor and it won't be as difficult but I will say now that the jury in this criminal case has spoken it might be just a little bit more difficult to get a jury in a civil suit to say listen I think Daniel Penney is liable for this wrongful de all right very interesting Terry Austin our thanks to you we turn overseas now to the news from Syria where it took [2674.20s] Rebels just 11 days to force president Bashar al-assad to flee they toppled statues of Assad and his father statues that represent their brutal half-century rule celebrations have been happening across Syria and in many other countries where millions of syrians were forced to escape many are now hoping to return but Assan aler leaves a political vacuum that different groups May struggle to fill our chief International correspondent James Longman reports from Damascus tonight syrians fought for years to topple him but Bashar al-assad is [2706.04s] tonight a dictator on the run as a rebel movement sweeps him from power in less than two weeks statues ripped

29-year-old Yousef who fled his country when he was just 17 I ask how he's feeling I'm so happy but with mixed feelings he says because I've missed so much my studies work but I'm happy he [2767.84s]

country when he was just 17 I ask how he's feeling I'm so happy but with mixed feelings he says because I've missed so much my studies work but I'm happy he [2767.84s] says the country Yousef will return to now run by this man Abu Muhammad Al galani who the US considers a terrorist having turned against alqaeda and now as the leader of the Syrian Rebel group hayam gani is striking a far more moderate tone Crossing into the country goani we meet the faces of his lightning Revolution I said he said why are people worried I said because Golani came from alqaeda Isis might be involved he said no there's nothing to worry about these young men not much older than 25 26 and [2801.32s] now Manning one of the main B post to Syria they are from a group which the world knows very little about but now they're in charge Assad evading capture fleeing with his family to Moscow where he was granted Asylum his Syrian Palace plundered dis inside luxury cars his fall after 50 years of family rule a major blow to Iran who funnel weapons through Syria and for Russia who has a key naval base in the country Lindsay I'm right in the center of Damascus here and there are signs of [2832.16s] Celebration everywhere these spent gun cartridges litter this entire area there is real Joy here but there's also real uncertainty no one knows what's going to happen next let it James Longman for us thank you during Syria's 13-year Civil War human rights groups estimate more than a 100,000 syrians from all walks of life including thousands of women and children were held in Bashar al-assad's notorious sedah prison north of Damascus with those prison doors now thrown wide open we're learning more tonight about [2862.68s] the dire conditions there here's our Tom Sufi burd jubilant scenes like these erupting around Syria over the weekend Bashar al-assad's violent dictatorship fell to Rebel Fighters at lightning speed but in the midst of the celebration light is now being shed on the worst of the Assad regime prisons in Syria are renowned to be some of the harshest in the world this is SED Nia [2893.08s] referred to as a human slaughter house by rights groups this video is shared by a non-governmental organization that monitors prisons where torture was systematic said n became a symbol of s's brutal rule today these prisons have revealed heartbreaking discoveries don't be afraid the man says to this woman found in an underground prison he finds a child alongside her this man allegedly fleeing from sedah [2923.72s] holds up 10 fingers one for every year he was in prison in this video Rebels shooting at bolted prison CS doors flung open former detainees seen hugging and cheering in the corridor thousands are believed to have been detained tortured and executed in siah for decades just north of Damascus the prison has two main facilities this the main prison the so-called red building where opponents of Assad's dictatorship were held and [2953.76s] just tonight Syrian TV reports of a mass grave found on Prison grounds but today the doors open and prisoners freed Rebels trying to control the chaos of crowds gathering at the prison hoping to find a loved one at least a trace of one Tom Sufi burd for us here now is someone who knows firsthand about Seda prison and its inhumane conditions Omar Al shog is with [2984.52s] us now thank you so much for joining us I know you were just 15 years old when you were first captured by Bashar Al Assad's forces how did you end up in the in the prison there I ended up in prison uh without a reason in Syria that's that's the interesting question in Syria you don't need to do anything to end up being political prisoner they just take you from the street they take you from your home uh at the checkpoint if the guard doesn't like if the soldier doesn't like your hair he could just beat you up and then put you in prison because they know they have immunity [3015.32s] they can't be prosecuted for their crimes uh so I was taken from my home with my cousin and we were taken to prison and then we were forced to give false confessions under torture those false confessions in the leading to uh an execution sentence from which I was smuggled tell us about the conditions that you endured as you can see in the released videos and photos from s prison it's a slaughter house it's a dark place where [3047.48s] uh you rarely dream of getting free out of that place or I would say never dream of get out of that place uh you have multiple floors and multiple guards with different expertise on wishes in which way they want to torture you and and what is the best way for them to enjoy torturing you uh give us a sense of that moment of Freedom what you felt what happened my moment of Freedom or the moment of freedom for hundred of [3078.48s] thousands of Syrian Prisoners the other day uh the for hundreds of thousands and for you personally I'll start with 100,000 I was here in this apartment watching the news one after one and I was crying during the night because I've been seeing videos of people in other cities and being liberated from prison so excited for every Syrian to feel the feeling of of Freedom that I once felt uh it was incredible I was so worried that the regime will execute a lot of prisoners when the opposition take over new areas [3110.76s] but luckily I think not a lot of that has happened uh and I see the people running imagine prisoners after 14 years some of them after 43 years of imprisonment were running free for the first time in the world they didn't know they even exist anymore uh so that was extraordinary moment it's the day I will always remember and that's what I worked for in the last 9 10 years so it brings me endless Joy uh And in regards to the day I experienced Freedom it didn't felt as [3144.80s] as good since I was in formed that I was taken to execution and I was put in room for 48 hours of preparation and every hour they will open the small window the door and asked me how do you want us to kill you and they put you through traumatic experience uh and then 48 hours later they took me and they put me on the ground and they loaded aimed and shot and uh when they shot I thought I died because I never died before I don't know how it feels to die after after 3 [3175.76s] years and uh and a car stopped behind me picked me up took me somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else things were moving on too quickly then I was in between my mother's hands and my mom told me that it was a mock execution and she bribed everyone from the top to the bottom even the execution guards were bribed to not shoot me so I could be SP do you think anything will change under a new government with the prison system and beyond I think everything would change [3206.72s] Syrian has been out on the street fighting with their lives they struggled they were tortured starved died chemical weapons rained on them for them to achieve this day of Freedom syrians will not let anyone who doesn't fit being power regardless of who liberated Syria in the last week it doesn't matter what matters is that we are uh willing to continue our fight to have a democratic process to end up with election democracies around the world have let us [3237.60s] down day after day after day they let us die in silence they did nothing not from the Great America not to Sweden nowhere in the world have done anything to help the Syrian people achieving freedom and democracy syrians have done it themselves and they will fight to have it and to keep it

York City subway he's feel good he's good penny seen at a Manhattan bar celebrating with his [3984.16s] attorneys he finally got the Justice he's deserved after 5 days of deliberations a jury finding the 26-year-old Marine veteran not guilty of criminally negligent homicide ne's father erupting in Anger after the verdict calling the system rigged I miss my son my son didn't have to go through this authorities say Neely suffered from mental illness and drug addiction prosecutors admitting the 30-year-old homeless man made threats on that Subway in May of 2023 but arguing that Penny's [4014.92s] hold was excessive and lasted almost a minute after Neely stopped moving I just put him out he the defense maintaining Penny never intended to kill I'm just trying to make like deescalate the situation the judge dropping the most serious manslaughter charge against Penny last week after the jury deadlocked but tonight all 12 jurors voting not guilty on that remaining lesser charge our thanks to Stephanie Ramos let's bring in Jordan ne's father [4045.52s] father Andre Zachary and his attorney Dante Mills thank you both so much for joining us on what we know is a very difficult day uh Mr Zachary let's start with you obviously you were visibly angry in court today just what went through your mind what were you feeling when you heard that not guilty verdict um it hurt me very hurt um I just didn't know what to say at the time but um [4076.08s] it hurt me to my core you know to hear something like that was there any time that you thought this might be the outcome I mean it shouldn't be no surprise but here we are you you said the system is rigged what did what did you mean by that and how would I mean it's been like that for a long time and that the system could be rigged the way it is and what do you mean by that racially [4106.44s] um it could be in many ways different ways but I'm not going to say racially right now but it could be in a lot of ways and we don't want to make this this isn't a black or white issue this is about everybody mattering um there's some people who look at this and say Jordan was houseless he had mental issues almost as if he deserved this to happen to him uh and there's no qualms we all have problems and even with Andre there were times where he could have been there more for Jordan [4138.00s] that that's understandable but it doesn't mean that Jordan deserved what happened to him or that you can simply choke someone to death and not be held responsible for it that's what we want people to understand this isn't a white or black thing this is all of us we all have that right um to voice when we are feeling something to be heard um and for someone to be held accountable if they harm us when they shouldn't you said earlier to day that you sought out and told the family you were going to get [4168.08s] Justice now you're going to go seek it through the Civil Court which you just started uh last week the civil suit uh give us a sense of of the timing on that and and if you think you might find Justice there we will I'm telling you we will uh the timing is we started the lawsuit not right away we wanted to see what the evidence was what the defense was going to be and when we heard in court all of the evidence where uh the incident was over after 30 seconds so whether or not Daniel Penny was right in acting to begin with the entire incident [4200.44s] was over in 30 seconds everybody was off the train and Daniel Penney continued to choke him for up to six minutes when people were saying let him go you're going to kill him let his hand we have his hands let his neet go you're going to kill him once we heard all of that that's when we began the Civil process and filed that lawsuit it's going to take some time it could be a year or two but we're not going to stop until we do have Justice because that's what our syst system calls for we're not in Rebellion right now we're following the rules of our legal system if you think [4231.12s] somebody killed someone uh and they should not have we have the right to follow a wrongful death suit and that's what we did from a legal standpoint what aspect of this do you feel that the jury didn't take into account that Jordan was a person that's the only way that you can see this situation and say uh that he did not deserve the justice that we were seeking on the criminal side is if you don't think he was valuable enough to do it he the only way you can say that is Jordan was scary he came on he scared [4261.68s] some people in the train that could be true but at some point you have to be a human and have humanity and say Daniel Penny could have let go before Jordan died he continued to choke him 50 seconds after he was lifeless he continued to choke him there's no there's no reason for that and there's no reason for a jury to say that that's not criminal uh Behavior it is uh Mr Zachary tell us about your son what you miss most about him well I miss his [4293.32s] voice I miss being around him I miss him dancing if you could talk to Daniel Penney directly what would you say why you didn't say you were sorry man come on man why you didn't say nothing would that have mattered sure it would have well Mr Zachary uh I'm sure it's it's not the same but we do want to say we're sorry for the loss of your son and we thank you both so much for for taking the time to come on and talk with us today thank Youk you thank [4324.32s] you we turn overseas now to the news from Syria where it took Rebels just 11 days to force president Bashar al-assad to flee they toppled statues of Assad and his father statues that represent their brutal half century rule celebrations have been happening across Syria and in many

She said the fingerprints were found on a snack bar wrapper and water bottle purchased at a nearby coffee shop.

                  "content": "as new details continue to emerge about the suspect in last week's murder of the United healthc Care CEO in Midtown Manhattan investigators have made a fingerprint match they say between the suspected killer Luigi mangion and evidence near the crime scene in New York City that new information released not too long ago by New York City's Police Commissioner commissioner Jessica Tish saying the fingerprints were found on a snack bar wrapper and a water bottle purchased at a nearby coffee shop [32.12s] while the gunman awaited his Target Tish also added that the gun found on mangion Match the shell casings found at the site of the shooting mangion is being held under maximum security at the State Correctional Institute in Huntington Pennsylvania were told placed in a Cell by himself a lot to discuss here so I do want to bring in Toby Brawn founder of American special investigative group and an expert in threat intelligence and executive protection thank you so much for taking the time to be here with us [64.48s] thanks for having me on of course well first off I do want to talk about the case overall as we've seen a lot of information come out over the past week pretty much on an hourly basis it seems what has stood out to you overall the most as the information the new details have come out well I mean first and foremost it was very uh clear to me from from day one of seeing the videos and seeing the information that was out there that law enforce person was dealing with an amateur versus a professional Hitman which is some of the other information that was it's been previously put out [95.24s] there uh everything from this guy's tactics to the fact that he had issues uh of using that firearm and and clearing the malfunctions to his movements to the the fact that uh he showed his face as many times as he did uh and and and overall this guy's Behavior Uh it was very uh very clear to me that we're dealing with an amateur and and obviously now a lot of a lot of new developments here uh and and I think it uh you know this case points on so many different things and I'm seeing some reports now or a lot of reports I [126.80s] which is quite concerning at this gu being called the hero by some um which I think also addresses uh the fact that there may be a greater uh uh anger that patients uh may have towards uh the the healthcare insurance industry and it does seem as though the attack had to have been very well planned in advance probably for for quite a while and I want to get your take as an expert there is that how it appears to you as you look at this as a whole absolutely I think this guy's been planning this for [157.20s] a long time uh not just going based on the uh uh uh the the manifesto that he's published uh but you could see him in the video he was doing surveillance uh um at the location prior to that uh he was clearly planning it uh by by the using the the ghost gun that he has made ahead of time putting those weapons together take some time getting the parts together and and really uh uh to be able to to to utilize that gun and pull it off effectively um all that would have taken significant amount of [188.24s] time uh also due to the fact that uh uh just there the sheer planning of getting to New York City using the fake IDs using the cash having all those things at hand having a backpack with the change of clothes in it um all that shows me that this was definitely a premeditated attack versus some something that happened uh in the spur of the moment and Brian Thompson the United Healthcare CEO who was killed in this shooting one week ago we are told by some of the family members that it appears he may have received threats prior to all of this happening what is [220.04s] kind of the standard protocol I guess when you have a big CEO like this or really anyone in a company that is receiving threats and is still you know going around he was going to a meeting there in New York city so what is the standard protocol is there one you know Josh it's one of the things that it really baffles me that this that that uh the CEO didn't have an adequate detail with him um considering the threats that were out there uh it's it's really it's really bizarre to me I'm not quite sure [250.48s] who was in charge of his security currently I'm not sure um who of staff was responsible for that uh but the fact that he was unprotected without any detail is is is absolutely it should have never have happened um generally speaking the protocol if if an individual like that receives threats well even beforehand because he is an individual at risk considering his positions and considering the amount of threats that are just out there not only for him but but to to CEOs in the the healthcare uh health insurance industry um and it it really it just required a [283.00s] significant detail threat intelligence which a lot of times threat intelligence can prevent a tragedy from the first place by identifying these Bad actors and then upping security when it's needed uh and then really having a an effective team in place and when we talk about security we talk about you know physical security for most people it's it's kind of like that you know the same thing but there's so many different layers to it and really having an adequate executive protection team of of of of a of a of individuals that are trained experienced uh that are armed because in this situation if if they [313.40s] wouldn't have been armed they would have probably been useless and and really having those effective measures in place having that planning having the advanced work done where you have now your team is going out out there ahead of time to know where the uh the principal is going um having 360 Security which in case would have been crucial to to to identify the attacker um all those things were were clearly not not done I mean he was there by himself and uh and it it's really U it's bizarre to me that this the guy was unguarded uh and and uh [344.12s] and clearly uh you know this was a largely result of uh of this tragedy from uh from from being enable to happen and what your looking at here on your screen is actually video from Altuna Pennsylvania that is the McDonald's where uh he was taken into custody can you tell me about some of the methods that law enforcement used amid this uh investigation that went on for several days prior to the arrest now it sounds like people at that McDonald's and that's some of the surveillance there [374.40s] actually recognized the suspect but I imagine that the work by law enforcement is what was able to tie the suspect to the crime sure and and and back to my original note that you know anybody who's calling this guy a hero the real heroes in this case of the NYPD Detectives um I know very have a lot of friends and and former colleagues that are uh that are MP detectives it's one of the greatest law enforcement agencies that we have in the country so hats off to those individuals those are the real heroes um the individuals at the McDonald's who who called it in uh those [405.60s] guys are the heroes the rookie police officer in that in that town in Pennsylvania who walked in the establishment recognized him again those are all the real heroes in the story uh now as far as the methods utilized well first and foremost it was you know you have New York City it's one of the it's it's it's one of our American cities that has the most amount of surveillance equipment uh uh that you could possibly think of uh facial recognition cameras there's there's it's it's really hard to go to go anywhere in New York City and not be under video surveillance and that really uh drastically uh helped these [435.72s] detectives in in um not only identifying this individual ultimately um but also tracking his movements and and and and tracking him from the crime scene uh to Central Park and then and then uh subsequently uh uh uh to the uh the later on locations that he that he visited um but really it comes down to using technology and old school detective work that these homicide detectives uh utilized to ultimately uh uh um you know work and identifying this individual and now also uh the uh the [468.60s] detectives that are working on putting together the pieces to to ultimately secure a prosecution for for for the subject um you mentioned the the evidence C was out there the fingerprints were found in the wrapper and the water bottle um the gun was identified in and NYPD crime lab from what I've uh learned today I just had just made a a um a discovery that the the ballistics of the firearm that was recovered and the shell casings on the ground is in fact a uh 100% match so [499.12s] again it's really overall this comprehensive approach of teamwork of La of of of solid law enforcement work um that that I'm very confident in uh will will ultimately lead to uh the guys's uh conviction and I do have to ask kind of going in reverse a little bit to something that we were just discussing a lot of people do hear a story like this and maybe they are a a CEO or someone with their company that is fairly high up and there was a lot of concern expressed after this did happen so I wanted to get your take as far as what people can do to kind of make sure that [531.96s] they are safe in a situation like this and this goes back to uh talking about the security that you were discussing a short time ago yeah I mean I think it all comes down to just doing H having having a security plan in place um having you threaten intelligence place to identify what are the risk factors uh getting an overall plan put in place to identify um what threats am I facing and and then having an expert come in and identify the solutions necessary uh to mitigate those",

what I've uh learned today I just had just made a a um a discovery that the the ballistics of the firearm that was recovered and the shell casings on the ground is in fact a uh 100% match so [499.12s] again it's really overall this comprehensive approach of teamwork of La of of of solid law enforcement work um that that I'm very confident in uh will will ultimately lead to uh the guys's uh

are safe in a situation like this and this goes back to uh talking about the security that you were discussing a short time ago yeah I mean I think it all comes down to just doing H having having a security plan in place um having you threaten intelligence place to identify what are the risk factors uh getting an overall plan put in place to identify um what threats am I facing and and then having an expert come in and identify the solutions necessary uh to mitigate those [562.92s] risk factors and it's really you know unfor unfortunately we live in a day and age where uh these attacks uh uh um you know have happened in the past they're going to continue to happen again which is also concerning because now we have the risk of CopyCat attacks and and really we have to take security more seriously and I think this is a situation a tragic situation um uh that really highlights the fact that um security is a necessity it's not just a burden it's not just an expense it's really a necessity and and investing in the right security uh uh [595.08s] will save lives um and uh and again it comes down to having that overall threat assessment done uh doing your threat intelligence and then having experts come in uh to identify procedures that that the individual needs in order to uh to be protected and I have to ask my final question here as far as questions that you still have that you hope will be answered soon obviously there's still a lot of questions this is only a week into the investigation but what question or maybe questions do you have that you [627.00s] hope will be answered soon yeah I mean I I think overall it comes back down to one of the questions I had is why was this individual unprotected and then and then secondly uh it's you know this this the suspect in this case here it's really not your typical suspect right I mean this guy's I leag educated he came from a good family to what we're learning uh he he didn't have any priors to to what it appears uh and it's really I think one of one of the questions a lot of people asking himself why this guy right what what happened there uh and and what happened in his in [658.24s] his in his head where he suddenly turned and decided to uh to premeditate this attack um and uh there's lot lot of speculation out there now that he's understanding he had chronic back pain and he could have been on on on some kind of medications that he stopped taking medications that have something to do with it uh or what happened in his life where he decided to uh to go out there and and and and plan this attack and and it seems like also that this is a uh the attack on um on Brian Thompson wasn't the only attack that he had [688.68s] planned it's seems like that he he had other uh attacks planned and uh um so I think you know really a question that the nation right now is asking uh uh you know is is is you know why did this all happen and and what is the and again it comes back to my original point it really also raises greater awareness of this of this anger that uh that you know patients seem to have and and I think that's something uh that needs to be uh looked into further as well all right Toby Brun thank you so much for taking the time to join us as [718.76s] always to help break down a very involved subject here anything else you want to add about any of this before I let you go know I think it comes down to is you know this and this suspect would not be in custody if it wasn't for a civilian in a uh uh in a a common location in McDonald's uh uh that saw something and said something and I think it's so important in our in our day and age as Americans uh we have to we have to stick together um if if you see something say something and uh and it really it can make our country a whole [749.48s] lot safer because law enforcement is thin there's only so many uh you know resources out there and and it's really often times it comes down to uh uh to responsible citizens uh to step up um when when when their time is being called and then secondly it's it's um U maintain vigilance right we're we live in a day and age where we're all on our phone and we're all just distracted by everything that's suround us um maintain that that situational awareness maintain that 360 Security uh and and and really be vigilant what's out there because un fortunately again threats are out there [781.36s] um and uh and the only way we we can prevent that is if we're uh if we're Vigilant and we if we take the proper precautions to to prevent any any any risks and and uh and mitigate those factors So Right Toby thank you again for taking the time to be here with us we appreciate it thanks for having me on Josh and I do want to pop up this image just coming in from our Fox 5 New York team as we continue to follow the latest on the investigation here still developing and there are a lot of questions now we are told by our Fox 5 [811.40s] New York team that a person

picture of a bag of bullets found in Central Park that are believed to be linked to Luigi mangion and by the way the evidence against him appears to be piling up police commissioner Jessica Tish today saying his fingerprints from the gun that he was packing on him when he was was arrested in Pennsylvania match fingerprints found at the murder scene [904.64s] the lawyer for 26-year-old Luigi mangion says he has not seen any evidence linking his client to last week's assassination of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson but NYPD commissioner Jessica Tish announcing today the gun mangion had with him when he was arrested at McDonald's in Pennsylvania is now at the NYPD crime lab we were able to match that gun to the three shell Cas casings that we found in Midtown at the scene of the homicide the [936.64s] commissioner goes on to say that mang's fingerprints also match those found on a snack bar wrapper and a water bottle that he bought it Starbucks shortly before the murder we're also able at our crime lab to match the person of interest fingerprints with fingerprints that we found on both the water bottle and the kind bar near the scene of the homicide in mtown more evidence has

to the city Steven Natasha back upstairs to you and that [1029.28s] was our Fox 5 New York team we're going to get Linda Schmidt to join us later on today to help break down those latest details but again we did get uh new details that continue to come in here about the suspected killer Luigi Manion now I do want to talk more about who he is and and his family what we've learned here over the last several days want to bring in Thomas moronic a lawyer local radio host and family acquaintance to talk more about that thank you so much for taking the time to be here with us [1060.96s] today thanks for having me appreciate it of course well first off I want to ask you about how you found out that uh Luigi had been arrested and what was going through your mind when you realize uh who his family is and who he is I had heard on the news wires I can't remember exactly where it might have been Fox for for all I know that there had been an arrest uh that had been made in this case and I saw that there had been local [1092.56s] connection and when I saw the last name I thought is this no it can't be could this be the same Manion family that I know and have appeared on their station as a host for 20 years could it be the same family and then I saw the pictures and it sure looked like a member of the mangion family he certainly bared the resemblance I was just in shock I I couldn't believe it this is the last [1123.76s] person you would suspect given the family that he's from which is so esteemed and uh respected in certainly Baltimore County but really all over the whole Baltimore region can you tell me a little bit more about the family I mean you said they were well-respected they are well-respected tell me about who they are because it sounds as though they are very well known in that area absolutely the the family is a very generous family they donate money to [1155.40s] charity they have a foundation that I think has4 and a half million dollars in it for which they give out uh some of that every year they have donated money that has adorned loyal univ univers of Maryland the pool named after them they're very generous as far as the St Leo's Italian Festival that they do every year and from a personal perspective um when they threw a holiday party this is years ago when Mr Nick [1187.28s] mangion senior was still alive they spared no expense at one of the best Italian restaurants in Baltimore they took everybody out uh and treated us like a member of their family and they have a huge family but that's sort of how the experience went if you were part of wcbm and you were one of the hosts or even an advertising executive everybody felt very welcome I I'll share this other story as well my talk show the Tom Moore Show oftentimes would Veer into uh [1220.24s] Realms they wouldn't usually travel on the station sometimes you get guests who were very controversial sometimes expressing views that perhaps the rest of the station you might not hear a lot but they didn't try to censor me they just wanted a good talk show that was provocative and supported uh my ability to do that and I couldn't thank them enough for it and you and I had kind of discuss this but you don't know necessarily a lot about Luigi it's unclear maybe if you had met him in passing or anything [1252.16s] like that right that's right Josh I I may have met him in passing at an event for wcbm but I don't recall it the family that I knew best uh included Nick mangone senior and then his wife Mary but more particularly his son Nick Jr who was president of the station for most of the time that I was on but uh Nick Jr took over the ownership from Nick senior and other members of the family were involved as well and uh he [1285.04s] really carried on the same tradition supporting good talk radio and wanting to to see the best shows be on the radio and that's the way I was treated anyway what are people in the community saying about all of this I imagine that there's a lot of discussion about what's happened the arrest itself so what are you hearing overall it's very interesting some in the community have been supportive of the mangion family which I think is the [1315.28s] right way to go with this there are others who have tried to sort of implicate them somehow because of the allegations about a member of their family and a friend of mine posted on Facebook about this and he said it's simply wrong to take your feelings about what happened it was a horrible tragedy a CEO gunned down in the streets of New York just just a terrible situation but to take that and somehow instill that on the family that that's [1347.12s] it's terrible that some people would do that but I I believe that the majority of people are not doing that and they understand this is still a very respected family and and they're dealing with a lot of trauma now as well because of the the personal experience of having a member of their family be accused of of something like this have you had a chance to speak to any of the family members since all of the news broke I have not uh my show ended in December of 2023 [1379.28s] so I've not been in regular contact with the mionis since that time but at the same time uh I I do touch base with uh some of the folks at wcbm I had had some conversations with them actually not too long ago so um but I know that no one at wcbm is talking about this understandably it's it's something where they put out a statement from delegate Dino Manion expressing their shock and their their horror about this and [1410.48s] offering condolences to the family and I I think that's probably all you will hear from the family my last question for you your thoughts now as there's been a little bit of time you've had time to process this overall what are your thoughts well first of all as a criminal defense attorney my thoughts are that everybody in this country is entitled to the presumption of innocence but particularly for Luigi mangion obviously the the facts that are being [1441.20s] alleged and particularly with some of the evidence today where the gun apparently matched the one used in the shooting all all of that is obviously concerning from the perspective of his defense um I I think the important factor is just let the facts come out and focus on what this is really about which is a tragedy the loss of Father the loss of a son the loss of an ex-husband and and um even though some have tried to politicize this I'm not [1473.04s] saying that there's not important issues in talking about claims and claim denials that's an a separate issue that's an important separate issue but the focus should be on the tragedy that occurred and getting to the truth all right Tom thank you so much for taking the time to join us here and talk a little bit more about the mangion family is there anything else you want to add before I let you go I think you covered it Josh it was great to be on with

Poss D was a Burgery that was happening she [1597.60s] came out with her pistol and shot the um 50-year-old suspect several times which house was it can you point to it it's going to be this house in this corner right here and the burglar came in through the front door it came in through I believe yes the front door do you have any idea if he was actually a burglar like is there anything that would indicate that he was here to steal from them um we're un sure yet how the entry was um you know we don't see any force entry or anything like that just he made entry to the residents and you [1629.56s] know just uh you know coming into a house and the daughter got scared and then shot the possible suspect multiple times so any charges that could be um as of right now um um as of right now it's unknown we're waiting till homicide homicide just showed up we're doing further investigations there only the information that we have right now so once we'll be able to get more information you know we could be able to provide for right now we just limited what we have or what we know from from what the daughter and father U said to [1660.12s] us can you give us an idea on the demeanor of the daughter like how is she doing right now is she kind of freaked out is she or does she like how is she feeling yeah you know she's you know kind of spooked you know anybody that come into your residence you know you don't know who they are you know you have a the meanor of you know being kind of a little bit scared of what's going especially you know firing at somebody you know should firing their pistol and then could be you know traumatizing the person so was this person killed inside the house or outside it was inside the house man he he was like probably like [1690.80s] maybe like 5T from the front front door total stranger have they seen the guy in the neighborhood or anything like that they said they don't know who he is was he armed um no nothing was found on him do you know if there were any words exchanged between um I don't believe there were any words um the daughter didn't say they just say you know they saw somebody coming inside and you know she shot her firearm have they been burglarized in the past um we are unsure about [1721.16s] that and was the father involved in this at all no the father was in a separate room that's what uh they told me and and then the daughter came out after she heard somebody coming in and that's when she came out with the fire Army and shot the suspect have any idea how old she is um no she prob I didn't get the age of how the daughter was an adult probably probably looks like she was in her 30s got it got any idea how many times he was shot or where he was shot supposedly he was um there was about seven or eight [1751.60s] showcasing that were found and he was shot three times in abdomen anything else no that's all information I have do you have any other questions anybody no good thank you thank you very all right a very brief news conference right there with Houston Police provided by our Fox Houston Station as they are on the scene Gathering more of the details at this point it's unclear if it necessarily was a burglary or what the situation was [1783.32s] still so many questions but we know that according to police a man walked into this uh home here and was shot by a woman Inside it sounds like several times as we gather more information from our Fox Houston team we'll make sure to bring that to you right here on live now from Fox do have to head to a quick two-minute commercial break now at 5:32 on the east coast and 2:32 on the west coast my name is Josh brlo and you're watching live now from [Music] [1815.44s] Fox welcome back here on live now from Fox and I do want to head to some international news that we have been following here the Israeli military now saying that it's destroyed 70 to 80% of the Strategic military capabilities of ousted Syrian president Bashar al-assad and his regime this comes after a 48h hour bombing campaign dubbed Bashan arrow that the Israel Defense Forces says was aimed at preventing these quote very Advanced weapons from falling into [1846.92s] the hands of the wrong people the IDF and the Israeli Air Force saying They carried out more than 300 strikes against those Targets in Syria want to bring in a friend of the show here to talk a little bit more about the situation developing there so let's bring in Mark Chandler director of government relations and professor of practice at Coastal Carolina University also a former senior defense intelligence official thank you so much for taking the time to be here with us you're welcome and good evening Josh [1878.00s] good evening well first off I want to talk about how significant this is for Israel because we're talking 70 to 80% of those weapons and just material that were used there by Syria so how significant is it but also why is Israel rather working to destroy all of that well I think this is a very significant move by the Israeli and and it's a strategic military decision when you look at what they're what they're doing they are methodically taking out a lot [1908.44s] of the offensive capability that that Syria had left behind so so if you will a big focus is on the aircraft the naval craft that can conduct those offensive operations but a very strategic and very prudent move is taking out the chemical Munitions and that's what Israel started with the other day you you know they're actually taking out targets that we the US had on a Target list years ago uh but the Obama Administration made a last minute decision not to take those out [1940.52s] and subsequent to us not taking out those targets the Syrian regime along with the Russians and the Iranians used those against against the Syrian people so you can see that was a strategic mistake we made that Israel is not going to repeat and so they don't want these to fall into the hands of any kind of government that's going to take over whether it's an extremist government or something that that may be more moderate we just don't know so I think this is a a prudent move by Israel and one that since they have the military Advantage [1971.44s] right now it's one that they're going to take remember they created this operation or this vacuum if if you will with the defeat of Hezbollah and Iranian and the Iranians inside Syria so I think it's a next logical step if you will and going a bit deeper into that we know that the US and the UK have said that they are all for this situation that is happening but then you have Qatar turkey and Egypt who are against this so can you explain some of the background there on why you have some countries that are [2003.72s] saying this is a good move and then you have others who are saying not so much well first off as I said I think the US is appreciative that Israel's kind of cleaning up the mess it left behind by not taking out some of those weapons of mass destruction when we had the chance about 10 years ago so that's part of it the second part you know the US UK has designated HTS a terrorist organization I mean when you look at the leader jawani he actually traces back to 2003 [2034.20s] my time in Iraq when he was fighting against us and he was started to follow the Isis leadership and the al-Qaeda leadership at that time so he he has ties to both those terrorist organizations regardless of the moderate approach it seems that he's at least on a public face putting out now we still have a five or 10 million doll bounty on jaan's head for what he did against us you know back in 2003 2005 and then [2064.32s] fighting with Isis and Al-Qaeda he actually headed alnus front when Al-Qaeda was trying to stand up in this during the Civil War so that's the US and UK perspective but what you're seeing with the Arab states you know you're seeing a combination of what they did to fight against the Syrian regime but also some reproach me that they've had in the last year to try to bring Assad back into the fold as an Arab state turkey I I can talk a long time [2095.00s] about turkey but turkey has its own initiative and ideas of what it wants to see come out of this the fall of Assad what impact is that likely to have not just on Israel but when you look at the Middle East as a whole when you step back what impact is likely there well I I you know this is something I wrote my students about this week and and what I told them is that you know this is a simal event in history that you see taking place in the Middle East you could see a reshaping of the Middle East [2127.28s] as we at that if if I can put Syria in perspective for just a minute when I go back at the start of the Civil War 13 years ago and if you were to look at a map of Syria today and color code it by all the different Rebel factions and then cut that shapes out what you would have is a jigsaw puzzle of significant proportion scattered across all of Syria now wait one week and guess what those colors change and the shapes change and that is the nature of the cultural the [2159.20s]",

significant proportion scattered across all of Syria now wait one week and guess what those colors change and the shapes change and that is the nature of the cultural the [2159.20s] religion uh the different sects that are all inside Syria today now they're vying for support you had one of the key leaders the HTS group that kind of has led this charge but you still have a different faction in the South you've got us supported uh efforts out in the Far East you've got Kurdish efforts that turkey absolutely despises up in the north and in the Far Eastern part of Syria and then as I said you had Arab [2189.76s] States involved in complete uh fighting against Assad throughout there and sometimes those Arab states would have their factions fight one another so so what's going to come out of this I think if anyone says they're an expert including myself that we know what's going to come out I I think we're way too early to tell that I I think you have to look at this change being something that could be as significant as when Yugoslavia fell and now you have all these different Balkan states there [2220.48s] you could see a fracturing of Syria into a multiple States or something that's kind of forced together again so it's it's really a dangerous time even though I know that the leadership the transition is talking about six to 18 months trying to bring some sort of rule to Syria but but Syria is kind of a hodg podge of different cultures tribes and religions thrown in there I think what what Israel did securing its borders taking out some of the offensive weapons is probably the prudent move and then [2252.52s] just kind of stay on the defensive remember Syria's invaded Israel twice unprovoked you know in the 60s and the 70s and I want to go a little bit deeper as you said not everyone can can look into the future and see what is going to happen but a big question that we've seen posed a lot and I just want to get your take on it overall I'm sure your answer will probably pretty much be the same it's a waiting game but we've had so many people who have asked what does the fall of Assad mean for the supreme [2283.52s] leader of Iran is that a possibility there that it could be impacted well I'm not going to say wait and see but let's wait and see what I think we have to look at is there's a similarity between two regimes that that were are both authoritarian and Assad fell apart uh because he he just had that ruthless authoritarian nature to him the difference here with Iran is is you have the Persian culture in Iran so it's a little bit more homogene [2316.36s] homogenous structure and and and build up or make up inside Iran but what I do think you're going to see is Iran is taking notice let me go back to the fact that Iran is is actually weakened with the defeat or or the Beatdown that Hezbollah has taken they've lost a staunch Ally in Syria since 1979 those two have been close allies so you start to see that fracturing the the supreme leader is going to take notes I think what you may [2347.32s] see is a kind of turning inward a little bit uh to to kind of re-calibrate its strength obviously the Israeli strikes back in October were a little bit more severe and meaningful had a significant impact on the regime because we haven't seen retaliation so I think you're going to see a focus inward to kind of build up and then try to figure out how they can go forward without the Syrian Ally to help Hezbollah build back up so I I don't think you're going to see a crumbling matter of fact you might see some more crackdowns if you see any kind [2379.00s] of protest inside Iran you know they'll come out a lot stronger on it but I think they're going to move forward and focus on what they can do to protect themselves let's head over to Gaza and talk a little bit more about the situation between Israel and Hamas overall we've heard this time and time again and you and I have discussed this but there are some rumbling so to speak that we may be closer to a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas does that appear to be the case just based on the information that you've seen coming out over the past [2411.36s] several hours and and maybe days are we any closer now than we were months ago well you know I have to say Josh that I am more optimistic uh these days and I have been in past interviews when I start to look at this a lot of the Arab countries utter Egypt and Saudi Arabia their press has released statements that Hamas is saying you know they're open to more discussions they're going to be more amable to certain things and even discuss the release of some of the names [2441.76s] of potential hostages to be released so that that to me is positive now today there was a spokesman a Hamas spokesman in Lebanon who came out and said no that's that's not true we're not going to do that however I think since sino's death since Israel killed senoir you've seen more openness from Hamas to consider a negotiation and I think that they probably is some truth to some of these leaks that are coming out from Egypt Saudi Arabia and gutter so I think we're we're moving forward positively [2474.04s] but with anything to do with these negotiations it it can slip up and fall apart you know at at any time and I just want to say you know getting those hostages out you know the hundred that are left but but maybe 50 are alive that's going to be critical to any kind of moving forward but Hamas has even said and this was a couple of weeks ago they're open to leaving Israeli TR troops inside Gaza so that that to me is positive I don't know you've asked me before if it'll happen before the inauguration that that could be a [2504.76s] pushing it or we could have some openings uh in the next couple of weeks my last question you're kind of an expert when it comes to the houthis and we haven't talked about them a lot but recently we did hear from uh the us maybe within 24 hours ago that they had actually uh thwarted an attack so to speak so what do we know about that and what are the houthis uh kind of up to are they still as powerful as they maybe were uh months ago well to to answer [2535.44s] your your last question first I think I think they're starting to feel the pain of some Israeli and US air strikes that had taken place back in October and early November but but as you point out uh they attacked two US destroyers just this past weekend you know that were escorting three commercial ships through the Babeland Deb and in the Gulf of Aiden so they're still viable in that one week ago they did the same thing those two same same two destroyers were attacked while escorting three other [2566.04s] commercial ships through the same area so the houthis still have a capability they're always going to have that capability I think putting Iran back on its on its heels if you will what Israel did is kind of slowing down the re resupply of the houthis but they're still there so you're you're going to look at how this plays out they're still going to try to attack matter of fact they did try a UAV and a missile attack on Southern Israel about uh the middle of last week so they're doing what they can but their their supplies they have [2596.76s] reduced supplies so as long as we can keep those down and stop Iran from RE supplying them they're G to kind of Peter out a little bit not go away but I think you're still going to see them kind of husband their assets if you will for these bold attacks like they did the last two weekends on Navy destroyers all right Mark Chandler as always thank you so much for taking the time to join us regardless of what time of day it is thank you again anything you want to add Before I Let You Go you're quite welcome Josh yeah I would just like to add [2628.04s] something uh about a a young man named Austin Ty you know Austin was a is a former Marine Marine officer but then he got out of the Marine cor and he became a journalist and and in doing so he worked for a lot of the different",

named Austin Ty you know Austin was a is a former Marine Marine officer but then he got out of the Marine cor and he became a journalist and and in doing so he worked for a lot of the different news agencies he was captured August of 2012 you know first he was captured by some of the the same Rebels that are in there in the different factions and the Syrian regime took control of him I just don't want us to forget the side of that you know while everything's happening hopefully you know we can get his release there there's strong indications [2659.92s] he's still alive but I just want to give that shout out for Austin and maybe try to get him Freed at the same time out of Syria and I was going to point out yeah we heard from some folks here in the US some high up officials over the last several days that there is evidence that he is alive so hopefully uh he is released soon mark thank you so much for taking the time to be here with us we appreciate it Josh my pleasure thanks for having me of course and I do want to take you out to this beautiful shop that we have over the White House in DC we are going to head to a quick break but [2691.08s] so much more live coverage to get to in just a matter of minutes you're watching live now from Fox my name is Josh breslo and we will be right back welcome back here on live now from Fox 551 on the east coast and 251 on the west coast Senator Kennedy and we tried to bring this to you a bit earlier but he met with cash Patel who is Trump's pick to lead the FBI after we learned [2722.40s] that Ry a bit earlier on today did announce that he plans to retire to step down from that position Kennedy did make some brief comments only about 3 minutes in length so I do want to play that for you here and these were right after that meeting we did very what did you think of your meeting with uh Mr pel who's good we had very Frank discussion about what's working at the FBI and what's uh what's uh not working and uh I picked his brain a little bit on some Foreign [2752.72s] Affairs questions since he has a uh a deep background in foreign affairs and and Counter Intelligence and uh it was uh was a good meeting is it the right move for Chris Ray to step aside as he is um yeah I think probably so um when your CEO wants to change uh it doesn't matter whether you have an employment contract or not you better off as the employee sitting down [2783.60s] with the CEO and having a a Frank adult discussion uh if you care about the institution and I think I think Mr Ray does and I think he he uh it was the wise thing to do what does that mean uh you know logistically with coming in and and rais I don't know I I don't know knowing uh if Mr Patel's confirmed and knowing uh director Rays I do I want to believe [2814.72s] that uh they'll sit down and talk uh and that uh Mr R will help the New FBI director any way can and I'm you know I I believe that that uh the director will will do that because I think he cares about the institution we all do um we all just want the FBI to work and uh I have uh my feelings I think are well known uh James Comey broke it um he hurt that agency badly because [2849.64s] he put his own politics and the politics of his buddies first and uh it hurt that agency and the agency needs to be fixed um and I just for the last several years we on Judiciary have been frustrated about uh whether it has been fixed I'm not saying it hadn't been fixed maybe it has and I just don't know it but uh one of the things that got my attention is when uh [2883.24s] um when when when they paid Mr Peter struck after what he did um paid him $2 million in a lawsuit supplement and wouldn't explain to me why they did it uh um that got my attention what Christopher Ray's Legacy don't know is there additional urgency to get um Patel confirmed now that Ray's stepping down I don't think it makes any difference we're going to go through the confirmation process we'll go through it [2915.36s] carefully like we always do uh and and uh all the nominees uh hopefully will look the committee members in the eye in front of God and Country and tell them their answer the questions and tell them about their plans did you talk to I got to run guys did you talk to Mr Pattel about his any desire to go after Trump's political enemies did that at all I haven't heard either president Trump or Mr Patel um say that's an issue I think [2947.84s] that's there's been an assumption among some members of the press that that's an issue but I haven't heard either of them say that they're going to use the job to go after anybody's political enemies other than America's political enemies which is what the FBI is supposed to do I think uh I think um there have been accounts of hot rhetoric that people have used in the past I've said things um um in the past [2978.68s] that I guess you could describe as hot rer but that's all going to come up in a confirmation here I have every confidence that my Democratic colleagues will bring up that and and many Republicans will and Mr Patel will be able to address it all right that was Senator John Kennedy after he did meet with cash Patel that is Trump's pick to lead the FBI after we learned earlier on today that Ry will step down from that position do have to head to our final [3008.72s] two-minute commercial break of the hour but so much

Fox 611 on the east coast and 311 on the west coast want to get back to a big story that we have been following here over the last week on live now from Fox as new details continue to emerge about [3708.68s] the suspect in last week's murder of the United Healthcare CEO in Midtown Manhattan investigators have made a fingerprint match between the suspected killer Luigi mangion and evidence near the crime scene in New York City that information released earlier on today by New York City's Police Commissioner commissioner Jessica Tish saying the fingerprints were found on a snack bar wrapper and a water bottle purchased at a nearby coffee shop while the gunman awaited his Target Tish also added that [3740.72s] the gun found on mangion matched the shell casings found at the site of the shooting mangion is being held under maximum security at the State Correctional Institute in Huntington Pennsylvania placed in a Cell by himself that is according to officials there were told that he was denied bail during a court appearance Monday in Pennsylvania and is fighting extradition to New York mangion was arrested earlier this week while at a McDonald's in Altuna Pennsylvania when an employee apparently recognized him from photos [3772.16s] circulated Nationwide by the NYPD now we did have Connor Hansen with Fox News who has been following all of the details as they do progress here I do want to send you over to his report with the latest new information the NYPD says it has linked the ghost gun found on murder suspect Luigi mangion to the Manhattan crime scene along with even more evidence fingerprints with fingerprints that we found on both the water bottle and the H [3806.20s] bar near the scene of the homicide in Midtown investigators have also recovered a spiral notebook that seems to shed light on the suspect's possible motive the New York Times is reporting one passage in the notebook reads quote what do you do you whack the CEO at the annual parasitic bean counter convention it's targeted precise and doesn't risk innocence those who know the suspect are now asking what would drive him to allegedly commit a Brazen murder the [3837.76s] Luigi that I knew

was a hardworking driven social kid who had everything going for him investigators are looking into the suspect's recent back surgery and trying to piece together his whereabouts after friends and

free speech and saying that's the way they're supporting my client the [3867.96s] suspect is still being held in Pennsylvania fighting a likely extradition to New York officials say he's in a maximum security cell by himself and is not under any kind of psychiatric watch in New York Connor Hansen Fox News Connor Thank you and we also heard as I mentioned a short time ago from the NYPD commissioner as well as mayor Eric Adams in New York now they were holding a news conference that was all related to to essentially ghost cars but they did touch on this situation [3899.96s] here so I do want to play those comments for you now on live now from Fox good afternoon everyone I'm chony Parker the deputy mayor for Public Safety on beh behalf of Mayor Adams we're here today for an important announcement about the progress of the mayor and the governor's multi- agency partnership to remove ghost cars illegal two- wheel vehicles and ATVs from the streets of New York City the mayor's North Star is always very very clear and that is to keep people safe his strategy [3931.88s] is that there we do that by Partnerships across all agency and Community lines we do that with a strategic plan and we do that by relentlessly following up to track our progress he's done that from gun violence to retail theft and every other Public Safety challenge ghost cars are an important part of the mayor's Vision because ghost cars one is people not paying their fair share and cheating and and evading tolls and tickets it's also to taking up parking spaces but from a crime fighting perspective ghost cars are used by criminals to evade detection to do robberies and other [3964.04s] kinds of very serious crimes with these cars that cannot be traced and it is now my honor to introduce the the 110th mayor of the greatest city in the world mayor Eric Adams thank you thank you thank you so much uh deputy mayor uh we were together this morning at Gracie Mansion with the uh task force on shoplifting U I was with one da this morning da cats and I'm [3995.04s] I'm happy to be here uh with an outstanding da here in St Island uh da MC uh McMahon and joined also by real Partners in public safety uh hope councilman uh barelli is able to make it as well I know he's he was planning on doing so but uh councilman uh David Carr and uh just an outstanding B president uh B president uh faella uh they really Embrace uh how we believe that not only [4028.32s] is my North Star but it's the north star of the city and every residence residence we must be safe and you have to go to all of those areas where Public Safety is being challenged and nothing uh is more important than dealing with with the ghost car issue many people think uh that these uh harmless victimless uh uh crime or criminal actions uh but they're not they play a major role in some of the crimes that [4059.80s] we're seeing taking place uh throughout our entire city so I thank Deputy Mayor Parker and his team for just continuing the work that Deputy Mayor Banks started and you just see a real continuation of our progress you know our kids our families in New Yorkers deserve to be safe uh these cars as Dean Parker indicated are not only are they used uh to circumvent paying Their fines and tolls but they also uh are part of the [4091.00s] hit and runs they're part of the uh robberies that we see uh they're part of the illegal Pursuits that we see just very uh arrogantly attempting to believe that the law does not apply to and earlier uh the partnership with the governor Hoku and state agencies uh We've Come Together to really deal with this issue pumping the brakes on ghost cars that are coming across our bridges and attempting to avoid the toll and [4121.48s] carrying illegal uh items and the numbers are impressive uh since taking office we have removed over [Music] 73,000 illegal Vehicles off our streets 73,000 and when you think about that number 20,000 of them are ghost cars and over 53,000 illegal mopeds unregistered um uh two wheelers and three-wheelers bikes and ATVs we have [4153.72s] focused on it and it it had gotten out of control because it was ignored for so long and we refused to do so uh we stated that this city would not be as city of chaos and a city of just people doing whatever they want and we zeroed in on these vehicles but what is interesting that these Outlaws use fraudulent defaced or non-existent license plates and other illegal vehicles to commit and evade [4184.40s] accountability for serious crimes including shootings robberies and hdden runs as I indicated as well as just believing that tolls do not apply to them and when that happens it increases the impact of the cost of tolling our bridges and our roadways and every day New Yorkers have to pick up that cost that's why this September we announced a new Ghost Car task force between the department of sanitation and the NYPD to [4214.68s] remove unregistered uninsured and stolen vehicles we were tackling this problem with the governor and other agencies uh within the law enforcement community at alolan booths and bridges uh but the partnership with a now Police Commissioner Tish and former uh Deputy Mayor Banks they stated why are we ignoring those vehicles that are parked uh we did an analysis and notice that when we were having many of our shootings in the cities and crime patterns these vehicles were being [4246.56s] parked on our streets and we zeroed in on them and stated that we will focus on the park Vehicles as well targeting Park ghost cars has boosted enforcement and accountability keeping New York is safe from crime and freeing up parking spots for La Biden drivers through this operation alone nearly 5,000 Park ghost cars were removed in 10 weeks 5,000 that was a real indication of a level of of comfortability of that those [4279.48s] who were using our streets uh to park these illegal cars and we sent a clear and Loud message and stated that it would not be tolerated or accepted in our inter agency City task force launched earlier this year with the state has seized more than 3,000 additional ghost cars on Bridges and tunnels we're not going to stand by while people break the law to fraud our city and endanger the public and so again I want to thank uh police commissioner uh Tish the NYPD acting [4312.32s] sanitation commissioner Javier loan and the department of sanitation for this collaboration and coordination as well as all the other agencies that are involved this is why we are continued to be the safest big city in America I cannot say that enough and we're continuously seeing crime uh being uh driven down in this city index crime overall is down over 5.7% in November and over almost 2% [4343.24s] overall for the year and last month alone we saw a decrease in Murder robberies burglaries and Grand lonies as well as the drop in transit crime and C theft uh we're just uh really continuing to great work who's here with us now in a different capacity uh uh Michael keer and what he did when he was running the Transit Police with continuing the foundational good law enforcement work that we're seeing our eff efforts to combat ghost cars fulfills both of these [4374.60s] missions and New York City Remains the safest big city because of the commitment and dedication to the officers involved uh and and I just want to take say a special thank you to those detectives uh that worked on of the uh healthc care shooting uh the number of hours they put in around the clock dedicated to bringing this person uh to Justice off the streets of America in general but specifically off the streets of our city and we look forward to prosecuting him [4405.48s] to the full extent of the [Music] law thank you mayor Adams it's now my honor to introduce the police",

really continuing to great work who's here with us now in a different capacity uh uh Michael keer and what he did when he was running the Transit Police with continuing the foundational good law enforcement work that we're seeing our eff efforts to combat ghost cars fulfills both of these [4374.60s] missions and New York City Remains the safest big city because of the commitment and dedication to the officers involved uh and and I just want to take say a special thank you to those detectives uh that worked on of the uh healthc care shooting uh the number of hours they put in

[Music] Tish good afternoon everyone thank you mayor Adams Deputy Mayor Parker and all of our state and local partners for being here today ghost plates and the vehicles that use them have been a plague on our city these streets since [4436.28s] the pandemic and for too long they were tolerated as just a toll evading nuisance but this Administration finally said enough last March we started at the bridges and tunnels pulling over ghost cars entering the city then in September we began targeting ghost cars as they sat parked in our neighborhoods all for the same purpose removing these unregistered untraceable and illegal vehicles from our streets and is the mayor said this year alone we've seized [4467.56s] more than 7500 ghost cars this includes more than 5,000 seizures in just three months by The Joint NYPD dsny pilot program a program that's being renewed based on its significant success this is not just about defrauding the DMV or avoiding tolls or avoiding red light and speed cameras more and more these vehicles are being used in the commission of violent crimes and we are seeing the same photocopied fake plates [4500.36s] used on different Vehicles as they flee crime scenes speed through school zones and cause collisions with no regard for other motorists cyclists or pedestrians but the days of operating these illegal ghost guards with impunity are over we are listening to New Yorkers who are telling us loud and clear that they want these vehicles off of their streets and out of their neighborhoods they want them towed they want them seized and they want them gone I heard [4532.00s] these pleas as a sanitation commissioner I hear them now as police commissioner and our inter agency task forces are fully committed to this work the combined efforts of the NYPD sanitation the MTA the New York State Police the New York City Sheriff's Office the Port Authority police department the dmbb and others are sending a very clear message if you drive a ghost car scooter or moped you will be pulled over and when necessary you will be arrested and the [4563.16s] vehicle impounded or if you park a vehicle a ghost vehicle anywhere in our neighborhoods we will remove it tens of thousands of these vehicles have already been seized over the past three years and although we've reached a milestone for these seizures today we are far from finished thank you very much thank you commissioner um it's now my honor to introduce our great partner former um NYPD Chief and um now chief of [4595.36s] security officer for MTA Mike keer thank you deputy mayor uh good afternoon and thank you for being here I'm Michael keer I'm the chief security officer uh for the MTA and I'm happy to be joined uh today by so many of our law enforcement Partners on on this uh inter agency task force you know as we uh near the end of 2024 uh we want to convey a simple message to anyone who still hasn't [4625.64s] gotten the word on total evasion don't do it you will be identified you will be stopped and you will be subject to Serious legal action including fines possible arrests and having a Vehicles impounded every agency represented here today has the tools the training and the technology to cap catch toll evaders and if you're skeptical just ask the 3,200 people whose cars have already been impounded or the 700 people who have [4656.96s] been arrested during one of our toll evasion operations just this year alone just ask them if we are taking this serious and ask them if there are real strong consequences we will remain Vigilant on toll evasion going into the new year make no mistake our efforts and this inter agency collaboration to combat this illegal Behavior will continue There Will Be zero tolerance for ghost cars and zero tolerance for criminals stealing Millions from New [4689.20s] Yorkers the mta's bridges and tunnels from the verzano to the RFK to the battery to the Midtown tunnels are gateways to New York City and we will not allow toll scammers and criminals to drive untraceable cars across them and through them them and bring Mayhem into our city this illegal conduct is not only unfair to lore abiding motorists while they are following the law and paying their tolls others have made the decision to circumvent it but as you are well aware [4719.92s] of and as is well documented criminals are using quote unquote untraceable ghost cars as a mode to and from crime scenes and acts of violence they participate in this all right so what you were listening to there was officials over in New York City as they were talking about a variety of topics related to crime in the city they did touch of course on the murder of the United Healthcare CEO a case that we are following very closely coming up here in just about 20 minutes we'll be joined by [4750.92s] our Fox 5 New York team as they have gathered new information on the investigation they will be here in just about 20 short minutes do want to head to a quick break but we'll have much more live news coming up in two short minutes you're watching live now from Fox we'll be right [Music] back welcome back here on live now from Fox 631 on the east coast and 3:31 on [4782.88s] the west coast viewer discretion is advised for this next story as it is incredibly disturbing a pair of twins and their older brother who face serious accusations of violent sexual assault arrested near Miami Beach Florida Alon tal and Orin Alexander real estate Giants known for their success in luxury markets in Miami and New York City have been indicted on three counts of sex trafficking fraud and coercion the indictment alleges that since 2010 the [4813.60s] brothers work together to operate a long-running sex trafficking scheme during which they allegedly raped and sexually assaulted women often drugging them the charges say the brothers would lure women to various locations where they were sexually assaulted sometimes by several men again a very disturbing story here and I do want to bring in a guest to talk a little bit more about it we have State Attorney kathern Fernandez Rundle in Miami day Florida thank you so much for taking the time to join us here [4845.48s] thank you Josh so much for allowing us to come and talk to you about this because it is such an important message uh with a very disturbing facts that involve all women throughout this country and what what what this case really stands for is that there's nobody that's immune to this situation that you know any kind of sexual assault or sex trafficking or any of those types of VAR varieties of sexual assault there that no one is immune from [4876.12s] that and it can happen to anybody and it transcends all socio and economic statuses so I think it's really good that you're covering this story so we can talk to listeners about how how they as victims if they are can come forward and have the strength to do that yeah and I did want to ask just kind of what goes through your mind what were you thinking as you saw kind of the details of all of this unfold I mentioned they are disturbing I've used uh that word a few times here but that's just an [4906.80s] accurate depiction you know it it is an accurate depiction it's it's actually in many ways a very gracious depiction because one of one of the very strong incidents that um we we you know we talk about and we there people will say it is the equivalent of a gang rape and there was an instance where one girl was lured to she was told there was going to be a part barbecue and when she got there she was the only guest and the three the two [4938.16s] brothers and their cousin fishermen were there and they literally you know kind OFA trapped her and held her down with knees behind the back holding down her arms and the twin brothers argued in front of her uh as to who was going to go first who was going to rape her first if you can just put yourself in that mind frame for a moment and she cried and she said no and she did what she could but she's completely [4970.16s] immobilized uh by the third man who's holding her down so they did they took turns in raping her and then when uh they were finished or and",

depiction you know it it is an accurate depiction it's it's actually in many ways a very gracious depiction because one of one of the very strong incidents that um we we you know we talk about and we there people will say it is the equivalent of a gang rape and there was an instance where one girl was lured to she was told there was going to be a part barbecue and when she got there she was the only guest and the three the two [4938.16s] brothers and their cousin fishermen were there and they literally you know kind OFA trapped her and held her down with knees behind the back holding down her arms and the twin brothers argued in front of her uh as to who was going to go first who was going to rape her first if you can just put yourself in that mind frame for a moment and she cried and she said no and she did what she could but she's completely [4970.16s] immobilized uh by the third man who's holding her down so they did they took turns in raping her and then when uh they were finished or and actually told her now you're going to have sex with our cousin the management holding you down and she just she became so hysterical she was unmanageable she ran she did everything she could and so we have charged them uh with a very serious crime of multiple it's it's called [5000.20s] sexual assault by multiples and so um I'm sorry about that and you know you think about that scenario you know where you're there and you're trapped and you can't move and the whole isolation the sense of fear just incredible why was it's so important for you and others there to make sure that these brothers were charged in this case I'm sure you put a lot of effort in the case a lot of resources there why was it [5031.48s] so important that they be charged well you know Josh I'll tell you why because and there are there are victims that suffer in silence I know that I've been a the state prosecutor here for many many years I have you know human trafficking Center I have a sex sexual assault Center that deals with Children of of sexual assault and what you find happens is so many of them suffer in silence and they're afraid or they're confused or they fear retaliation or [5064.60s] they fear social societal uh you know recusal of them and so they don't want to come forward and sometimes they'll tell a sister a mother an aunt an uncle a husband in one of these cases came forward and he was the one that gave the strength to one of the victims to come forward but you see until others see that you can survive this and it's not about you the victim it's about the abuser it's about the rapist no matter [5096.16s] how wealthy or how poor he is no matter how high in society is regarded or he's not regarded at all it doesn't matter you as a victim have a right to hold them accountable and that's why I think this case is so important because you know sometimes women are afraid because people like the abuser they're popular you know they're wealthy they're high society they're on the front of magazines and then they say oh my gosh if I come forward and I'm not saying [5127.92s] that's just this case this is all kinds of celebrity type cases and we saw that with the me too movement a couple of years ago when women could see other women come forward takes a lot of Courage a lot of courage to go tell your story to the world and you know what other women saw that courage they were they were inspired by it they admired it and then they did it and so you know I'm hopeful uh that out of this tragedy of for these three victims that we have [5159.40s] here and I know New York has some other victims and in your jurisdiction um that other women if they're there come forward we can do this you can do this you kind of already did this but if there are those women who are out there obviously I would imagine you are looking for the possibility of more victims so there are some women who are maybe afraid to come forward what do you say to them and again you kind of touched on this already but what message do you want to get across to [5190.04s] them I think it's when you feel that you have been wronged do not blame yourself this isn't about you you didn't do anything wrong you've been a victim somebody abused you I'll give you an example one of the other cases we had Josh I there's a beautiful woman uh as far as she knows she went out on a date with somebody and the next thing she knows is she's immobilized by what she believes was in a drink that she was given she was given a drink I believe it [5221.56s] was wine and they were chatting and the next thing she knew she couldn't speak she couldn't move her body she was paralyzed in so many ways but you know what she didn't do anything wrong what he did was he wanted to have power over her he wanted to have control over her so he immobilized her to do that there's so many women out there that probably have had this happen and you know what don't be afraid don't be ashamed for any reason that person that did that to you [5252.60s] that's the person should be ashamed we have hotlines Josh uh it's 305 547 3300 we have a whole safety net of services we have Advocates that are Specialists uh therapists we have a support system and the last thing I would say because I I know you've been kind enough to give me just a few minutes here you know usually someone who's been raped tells somebody and it's usually someone that's close to them a sister a relative a mom [5285.88s] and if you know your loved one has been raped or sexually violated or trafficked or any of those variations of a horrible scheme tell them they can come for give them the courage it's cathartic they'll feel so much better when they get it out of their system and see like tonight those two men those two brothers they're sitting in our local jail all night tonight and so people will be held [5317.20s] accountable and it's a very important subject in situation so you can have all the time you want I I did want to ask about the investigation as far as the charges that have been filed at this point are you able to say if there could be some other people out there some other suspect who could be arrested and charged in the situation or do you believe that you have everyone that was involved you know Josh I never I never feel like we're finished right when we start and as we move for actually we [5349.04s] pull this case together fairly quickly uh on these three victims and so I don't know what the future holds but I do know that we're not stopping and you know all this kind of exposure that you wonderful people and the media are giving this topic it should be very encouraging inspiring to others to come forward so I don't know if there are the perpetrators and I know if there are the victims I hope there are none of each but if they are then we want to know about it and [5379.68s] hopefully when people see that something gets done about it right it's not just telling your story nothing happens here three women came forward they told their story and three men are going to jail and so so that's the beginning of seeking some sense of justice for these victims but also to hopefully prevent others either perpetrators that are predators that are listening to this you know understand you cannot force [5411.00s] immobilize traffic sexually assault or threaten to sexually assault someone because you will be charge and you're looking at serious charges and to the victims out there don't let those guys get away with it come forward you're the victim please have the courage look at these three ladies they did it you can do it all right Katherine Fernandez Rundle thank you so much for taking the time to join us here and provide some additional perspective into the [5441.16s] situation that's unfolding is there anything else you want to add about any of this before I let you go well I do want to just say Josh that you know this really was teamwork and so one of the things about uh South Florida in particular I think and perhaps New York feels the same way is they have a great law enforcement community so this was a collaboration the F the local FBI were fantastic the Miami Field office they really helped coordinate with Miami Beach Police Department my human trafficking uh Commander task force of [5473.80s] our task force and we all work together to make sure that the search warrants that the New York office of the US attorney's office in the southern district of New York had had obtained that those were executed in a in a very safe and and effective way and that the arrest on our charges were also effectuated and so they're in jail they were transported to a local jail so again a big thank you uh to all the people that had something to do with bringing this case to fruition and we [5504.92s] want to wish our colleagues at the US attorney's office in New York uh much good luck with their case anything we can do they know we and ready and able to assist thank you",

regime is a fundamental Act of Justice it's a moment [30.08s] of historic opportunity for the longsuffering people of Syria it's also a moment of risk and uncertainty now cautious optimism as questions Mount about what happens next we have Team coverage also developing new clues in the search for a killer New York police releasing more photos of a person of interest in the shooting death of health insurance executive Brian Thompson investigators recovering a backpack full of Monopoly money believed to belong to the shooter bring you the [60.40s] latest plus an NBC News exclusive

the rappers scathing response and removing the red the Food and Drug Administration planning to ban artificial food die a common ingredient in food and drinks more on the move and what it could mean for you out of many changes we may see coming soon to the [91.28s] FDA yes it's definitely good to have you with us on a Monday morning I'm Joe frier and I'm Savannah sers thanks for starting your week with us we're going to begin our show with the dawn of a new chapter in Syria this morning people there are waking up to their first day without president Bashar al-assad the Syrian leader ruled the country for 24 years before fleeing to Russia over the weekend in the wake of a rapid two-e Advance by Rebel forces many syrians are celebrating the collapse of the government and the end of a near 14-year Civil War that killed almost half a million people International [121.60s] organizations accuse the Syrian government of committing human rights abuses including torture and kidnapping but Syria's future remains uncertain the rebel insurgents that spearheaded the offensive are part of an Islamic group known as HTS they're considered a terror group by the United States and the United Nations speaking yesterday President Biden welcomed the downfall of the Syrian government and said his administration would begin work on a transition for the country we will engage with all Sy groups including [151.92s] within the process led by the United Nations to establish a transition away from the Assad regime toward independent Sovereign an independent independent I want to say it again Sovereign Syria with a new constitution new government that serves all syrians this process will be determined by the Syrian people themselves we've got a team standing by to cover all of this we are going to start with NBC News International correspondent Raph Sanchez Raph good morning all this happened so fast just [182.16s] walk us through the events of the last 24 hours and the reaction we're already getting out of Syria this morning Joe Savannah good morning so fast the history of the Middle East Rewritten at lightning speed Bashar al-assad and his family ruled Syria with an iron fist for more than 50 years but their regime crumbled in less than two weeks in the face of this Advance by Syrian Rebel Fighters they burst out of North West Syria taking city after City [212.64s] and in the early hours of Sunday morning they entered the capital Damascus seizing control there Bashar al-assad Syria's toppled president fleeing to Russia along with his family his regime really didn't put up a fight at any stage during this Rebel advance and what we've come to see is that this was a truly brittle regime that without the help of its main backers Russia who over the last 2 years has been distracted in [243.08s] Ukraine Iran and Hezbollah who have been weakened fighting against Israel over the last year Assad's forces really were in no position to fight themselves they threw down their weapons and today the rebels are consolidating power in Damascus as you mentioned the rebels are led by an islamist group it has its origins in al-Qaeda it is considered still to be a terrorist organiz ation by the United States but it is going to Great Lengths [273.96s] to try to signal to the Syrian people and to the world that it's moderated its leader Muhammad Al jolani was in one of the historic mosques in the old city of damasus yesterday he's promising a government for all syrians that there will not be reprisals against political enemies against minority groups and people around the region around the world are watching to see as this new Rebel government takes shape guys yeah R let's talk about what could come next I [305.00s] mean there's concern there's uncertainty especially since the main Rebel group here they are considered a terrorist organization by the US tell us more about the president's reaction to these events and what we will see next so President Biden speaking at the White House yesterday saying that this is both a moment of opportunity and a moment of risk and at the center of that balance are these Rebels the main group called Hay T al-sham and the US it says [335.52s] that they will judge them by their actions take a listen we will remain Vigilant make no mistake some of the Rebel groups that took down Assad have their own Grim record of terrorism and human right abuses we've taken note of statements by the leaders of these Rebel groups in recent days and we're they're saying the right things now but as they take on greater responsibility we will assess not just their words but their actions now senior Administration [365.88s] officials were asked yesterday whether the United States would think about removing that Terror designation from HTS they said that that is not a step that they are going to take at this time but that they are finding ways to engage with them uh it's worth saying HTS is the largest Rebel group but there are a number of other factions some of them backed by the US by American Allies like Jordan who are also playing a role in Damascus one of the big questions here is how these different Rebel groups will work together going forward guys Raph on [398.04s] top of all that many syrians are celebrating the downfall of the Syrian government but Israel says it's been carrying out air strikes there it's even launched a ground operation tell us what Israel's goals are here yeah so guys I just want to give you a little sense of the geography here if uh control room can come back to me I'll explain exactly where we're standing we're on the Israeli controlled side of the Golan Heights we're looking out over Southern Syria Damascus is Over the [428.80s] Horizon and this used to be a buffer zone with Israeli forces on one side Syrian troops on the other but as the Syrian regime has collapsed Israel has moved its forces inside of Syria itself now the Israeli government is saying this is a temporary measure it is designed to prevent instability to to make sure that the conflict in Syria doesn't spill over into Israeli controlled territory on this side of the border Israel also as you said carrying [459.96s] out air strikes targeting chemical weapons biological weapons ballistic missile facilities inside of Syria and what the Israeli government is saying is that it is absolutely determined that these strategic weapons do not fall into the wrong hands especially into the hands of terrorist groups operating within that broader Rebel Coalition yeah we also understand the US carried out air strikes on Isis targets speaking of in Syria in the wake of this takeover How concerned is the Biden Administration that the group could take [491.28s] advantage of a power vacuum yeah it's a major concern and that is exactly the term a power vacuum you have a lot of chaos inside of Syria right now Isis thrives in chaos it thrives in areas where there are not governmental authorities the US says that one step it is taking is it's going to keep those roughly 1,000 ground troops inside of Syria they are in a largely Kurdish controlled area in the eastern half of the country there's no [521.64s] indication that these Rebels are any threat to those American forces but as you saw even with these whirlwinds political changes going on in the capital those American counterterrorism operations continuing in the east of the country guys R thank you very much for your reporting let's continue this this conversation with Hagar shamali she's the host of oh my world on YouTube and the former NSC director for Syria and Lebanon Hagar always good to have you with us so first off just put into context the significance of what we're seeing unfold in Syria right now not [552.52s] just for Syria itself but for the region as a whole sure it's I mean it's absolutely astonishing there isn't any foreign policy expert or any billions of dollars of intelligence that could have predicted what we saw in Syria over the last week and certainly over this weekend and I want to put it in the 60,000 foot level because it reflects larger geopolitical Dynamics this wouldn't have happened without the weakness that you're seeing among Bashar Al Assad's Club of baddies Iran Hezbollah Russia Iran's on the defense hezb has been decapitated and Russia [584.60s] importantly is obviously distracted by Ukraine but Russia is critically the one that saved Bashar alassad in 2014 during the Civil War and shifted the tides in favor of him and without Russia there's he wasn't able to do it and so the way he fled like a coward is nothing we could have predicted and most importantly it was the military defecting a dictator cannot stand without his military and so to watch them defect and leave their post this way that's critically also why he had to run away before they before they [616.04s] captured him Hagar with all that being said just how surprised Were You",

defecting a dictator cannot stand without his military and so to watch them defect and leave their post this way that's critically also why he had to run away before they before they [616.04s] captured him Hagar with all that being said just how surprised Were You by how quickly the Syrian government collapsed here and help us understand why Russia this time around did not come to Assad's defense yeah was definitely incredibly surprised because a week ago when the rebels had taken Aleppo my expectation was that Assad would respond with the same force that he responded throughout the civil war with indiscriminate bombing of civilians done in partnership with Russia and Iran even though Russia and Iran are much weaker that doesn't [647.52s] mean that they don't actually have some resources to lend but if they're all on the defense and Russia is distracted then they're not going to want to invest in Assad I think that's a key part right after that happened Assad flew to Moscow to kiss Putin's ring and beg him for support and Putin didn't give it to him and again Putin is very focused on Ukraine he himself is struggling and spending his resources which is why he's relying on others like North Korea but that said there's also this belief there clearly that this was not a dictator they felt the need to invest in anymore [678.60s] this Uprising and the fact that the rebels did this is because Assad himself did nothing to appease his people to support them with their protests and so I think they also lost faith in him as as well while many are celebrating the fall of Assad the fall of this dictatorship there are of course worries about what does come next this main Rebel group that spearheaded this takeover designated terrorists by the US what do you think comes next and how will the Biden Administration proceed given we're just a month away from the incoming Trump Administration sure well I I have never [710.76s] seen to be honest with you I've never seen in my experience an islamist militia that was once designated as a terrorist group change its ways so radically that they actually become the beacon of democracy and the reason and we and the proof is in the pudding this is a group that that controlled Northwestern Syria as it is and they controlled it with a a a conservative if not often extreme Sunni ideology they did crack down on descent they did crack down on minorities there and so there isn't a lot of Hope for me and the problem that you see in Syria as well in [742.12s] general when you have a vacuum like this you're going to have a lot of rebels take advantage the Biden Administration the best they can do is Ensure the protection of Kurds and that Isis doesn't reemerge and most importantly the release of American journalist Austin TI who remains in Syria and is well and Alive Hagar shali thank you for joining us this morning the murder mystery that has captivated the nation is deepening yeah police release new photos of a man they are calling a person of interest in the deadly shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson investigators say the [773.76s] pictures are from the taxi that person took to a bus terminal after the murder police also said they found a backpack they believe belongs to the suspect but here's a strange detail it held a jacket and Monopoly money for more let's bring in NBC News correspondent Valerie Castro she is in Midtown Manhattan Valerie good morning so we have these new photos this possible backpack belonging to the person of interest any signs police are any closer to finding the suspect Joe and Savannah good morning we know the clues continue to slowly [804.28s] trickle in in this case as of course as you mentioned NYPD releasing those new images of a Person of Interest over the weekend that man wearing a mask seen in the back of a taxi cab and walking alongside that car but police sources say investigators have not made a positive identification of the suspect or Person of Interest that they are looking for in this case they do continue to search for the weapon that was used in the shooting the NYPD deploying dive teams to a lake inside Central Park over the weekend we know [834.72s] the suspect was seen on surveillance video riding a bicycle into and out of Central Park following the shooting so dive teams were searching for that weapon somewhere in the park uh uh D NPD also sending out canines that specialize in gun detection to Upper Manhattan where the suspect is believed to have last been near the bus terminal uh near the George Washington Bridge uh thinking that the gunman may have stashed the weapon in that area before likely leaving the city Joe and Savannah Valerie investigators though are [865.84s] expanding their search right out of New York out of the whole tri-state area even including nearly a th miles away to Georgia tell us more about the locations that are being searched and who's involved yes Savannah last week the NYPD put out a very detailed timeline they say the suspect is believed to have arrived in New York City by Greyhound bus at the Port Authority bus terminal in late November and that bus they say originated from the Atlanta area now later in the day of the shooting they [895.96s] say the suspect was seen leaving Central Park on a bicycle getting into a taxi cab and heading to another bus terminal in Upper Manhattan where they believe he may have also boarded a bus leaving the New York City area they are checking to see if there is surveillance or photos of that suspect boarding another bus potentially headed towards the Atlanta area we know Atlanta police are now also involved in this investigation and Valerie the shooting is sparking backlash against the American Health Care system and some rather unexpected [926.20s] reactions over the weekend there was even a shoot lookalike competition in New York how's United Healthcare just responding to this attack right now yeah Jay you mentioned that lookalike competition it's become sort of a light-hearted thing here in the city over the last several months there was a a Timothy Shalom look Alik contest a few months ago in Washington Square Park the actor himself showed up but that event took sort of a dark turnover the weekend when someone organized a lookalike competition for people to [957.04s] arrive dressed as the gunman people showed up wearing hooded jackets masks over their faces unclear if anyone was declared a winner uh United Healthcare has not issued any new statements other than the one that was issued following the shooting calling Thompson a highly respected colleague and friend we have learned that today a funeral service will be held we're told that service is private Joe and Savannah all right we see there temporary fencing also being put up at United healthc Care's headquarters Valerie Castro thank you so much for more now we are joined by NBC [988.00s] News terrorism analyst and retired ATF special agent in charge Jim kavana Jim good morning so New York city mayor Eric Adams said over the weekend the net is tightening on this suspect we've got a little bit of new information new evidence like that backpack these photos but with all the high-tech surveillance technology that exists in New York how has the shooter been able to evade capture what do you make of that well you know they just haven't been able to pick his identity up off a camera or uh a tip just yet at least they haven't been able to zero in on him [1019.72s] they may may very well have his name uh in the database of names that have come through on tips that have given threats to United Health Care that have been uh uncovered as someone who might have lost a loved one in the Health Care system and is upset uh there's all kinds of ways that names come into task forces running big cases and you always have plenty of names and suspects to look at uh the key is can you get you know under the theory of transfer that the killer left some of their DNA fingerprints U uh [1053.48s] possessions at the crime can you get something that can positively identify a person that then you then look at you know it's not necessarily what everybody thinks that you have to get DNA and put in a computer and find the answer or the fingerprint what you really want as the commanders investigators is I want that DNA that I know I can identify or a fingerprint a partial a complete fingerprint something that I can say if I catch if I have a suspect I can determine if it's him or not and so that's what they're searching for of course they're looking for the gun in [1084.28s] Central Park which is a very good move uh they need to get those uh bomb and gun sniffing dogs which ATF uh supplies them and to all the police uh and they'll find a bullet they'll find a gun so you know get a bunch of them up there be looking for the gun get in the pond with the",

get in the pond with the divers that's another good lead this is a big week for the detectives so they need to press and press and release more of these pictures as they get them so Jim I mean police say it appears the suspect took a bus out of the city after this murder New York is big enough on [1115.68s] its own just how much harder does this make it for police to find him knowing this person could be anywhere right now oh no no doubt about it he could be anywhere he could be in the wind I mean he could be you know hiking the Appalachian Trail or went up camping on the mountain or he could have went back to his home and his job and his and his routine uh the key is that some tip some uh lead uncovers a name and then they can look at the photograph of the name that goes with the name a driver's [1145.80s] license oh this this person here is you know 75 years old is clearly not the guy we're looking for this person here he beats the age description what's his connection well he made a threat to the uh the CEO PRI previously oh okay well maybe we ought to investigate him let's interview him uh you know where were you what do you know uh would you let us take a swab of your saliva you know can we check see if he has fingerprints so that's how they're going to catch him they're going to catch him through information they develop from tips from leads and then be able to match it to [1176.68s] fingerprint saliva DNA at the scene we are on day six of the investigation where do you think police go from here and would you be concerned if you were involved here that it's been six days and and you haven't been able to crack this yet no actually there's a lot of leads here I've had many very difficult bombing and murder cases where I didn't have fullface pictures of the suspect and this many chances at DNA and fingerprints maybe a dropped cell phone and a chance of finding the gun and his [1208.92s] jacket in a backpack to me this is great evidence and the NYPD detectives and Collective wisdom experience training they're going to put this all together so no I think this is a a very very solvable case I think they're going to solve it uh it's a big week for them they need to press hard on it uh push the picture out they they've the reward up with the FBI so those are all good things they need to press hard this week maybe get a little break in the case all right Jim Cabana always appreciate your time thank you so much well an NBC News [1240.12s] exclusive president-elect Trump gave his first broadcast television interview since winning back the White House last month Mr Trump sat down with Meet the Press moderator Kristen Walker for a wide ranging conversation about his plans for a second term and his first 100 days in office you've talked about prioritizing people who have criminal histories correct but is it your plan to deport everyone who is here illegally over the next four years well I think you have to do it and it's a it's a very tough thing [1270.20s] to do it's um but you have to have you know you have rules regulations laws they came in illegally you know the people that have been treated very unfairly or the people that have been online for 10 years to come into the country when asked about members of the January 6th committee honestly they should go to jail so you think Liz Cheney should go to jail for what they everyone on the committee you I think everybody anybody that voted in favor are you going to direct your FBI director and your attorney general to send them to jail no not at all I think that they'll have to [1301.44s] look at that but I'm not going to I'm going to focus on drill baby drill when you say that it carries weight though you you you know you've tapped these people to lead the justice department and FBI they can do whatever they want but the president-elect says he is looking to pardon people convicted for their actions on January 6 we're looking at it right now most likely yeah

to the week not only today [1394.56s] Tuesday Wednesday and Wednesday is going to be very soggy helping out the drought situation this is what radar looks like right now you can see the rain falling from the Great Lakes all the way through the Ohio Valley parts of the Appalachians into uh the southeast and we have a flood R throughout Golf coast states as we go throughout the day because we will see heavy rain and we're seeing that heavy rain in some spots where you see those brighter colors behind this we're looking at cooler air working in so as we go throughout today we're going to see this front making its way a little bit closer bringing the chance for some rain heavy at times and also new snow for the great lakes also [1425.96s] New England the lake effect snow machine just uh kind of shut down right now we're seeing some rain that's going to turn way back up Wednesday through Friday we're looking a pretty significant lake effect snow event Wednesday into Friday then by tomorrow we're looking another surge of moisture along the east coast again pockets of heavy rain that's going to help the drought situation especially in the uh Northeast New England also the Mid-Atlantic a few stronger storms are possible in the Southeast as well that could bring some Gusty winds some heavy rain by Wednesday showers targeting the Northeast we're looking at Lake Effects snow returning late Wednesday into [1457.04s] Friday so we will see accumulating snow once again there rainfall forecast we're going to see a lot of it from New England all the way down to the southeast notice those darker colors that's where we're going to see the most amount of rain and that is uh true to for the snow we're looking at some pinks and purples there along the Upper Midwest the up of uh Michigan into parts of the Great Lakes where we will see some accumulating snow there flash flood risk today for New Orleans mobile but it could extend portions of Georgia and also Alabama Mississippi and then by tomorrow Columbus Atlanta that's going to be the target for some really heavy [1487.88s] rainfall could see some flash flooding there but notice that area kind of expands so now we're talking about portions of the midatlantic as well it shifts into the Northeast into New England on Wednesday Boston Bang Burlington could see flash flooding on Wednesday and then it's really warm guys this time of year usually we get rain but it always comes at up price with or you get if you like the mild a it comes at a price with rain and that's what we're going to see over the next several days then plummeting uh Wednesday and Thursday so dreaming of a wet Christmas and then cold and just burn that would mean it would snow if it rains right at [1518.72s] that point it would snow if it rains what later when it",

the cold great Michelle thank you a little bit what much more to come here on Morning News out later this hour housing help more first-time home buyers saying they're getting financial help from family more on the trend and what it means for the market we should not do weather clearly it's Michelle's job all right up next after the break a memorable mass at the iconic notredam Cathedral back open for the first time [1549.92s] since that devastating fire 5 years ago we are going to take you to Paris next legendary rapper Jay-Z is denying an allegation that he and Shawn Diddy comes raped a 13-year-old girl yeah an anonymous accuser identified only as Jane Doe made the accusation in a civil lawsuit on Sunday it alleges that the assault happened after she was driven to an MTV Video Music Awards Afterparty back in 2000 in a statement to NBC News [1580.12s] Jay-Z whose real name is Sean Carter called the accusation idiotic adding quote these allegations are so heinous in nature that I implore you to file a criminal complaint not a civil one whomever should commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away would you not agree attorneys representing comes also dismissed the lawsuit calling it a Shameless publicity stun comes is currently behind bars at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center after Federal prosecutors charged him in September with racketeering and sex trafficking NBC News legal analyst Danny [1611.60s] savalos is here to break down some of this for us Danny good to have you with us these are serious allegations tell us a little more about what accusations the accusers making here that happened back in 2000 and just typically how a case like this then would play out in a civil court proceeding according to the amended complaint and when I file amended complaints it's because new information has come up maybe there are new defendants and new claims and that's sort of what's Happening here but I'll explain the difference uh this amended complaint alleges that this 13-year-old plaintiff when she was 13 wanted to go to the VMA Awards couldn't get in a limo [1642.56s] driver says come on in you're and I'm paraphrasing you look like you're Diddy type or something like that she gets in she goes to the party and at the party she is assaulted originally she had alleged obviously Diddy or comes now what there isn't really a new defendant in Jay-Z what the complaint alleges is that somebody that they had originally referred to as say celebrity a now they're naming as Jay-Z and so they alleged that Jay-Z and Colmes were involved in the assault of this uh [1672.92s] 13-year-old then 13-year-old plaintiff so Jay-Z was technically already in the complt he just wasn't identified what goes through that point that that was in Jay-Z's statement there about changing the type of lawsuit here civil versus criminal so Jay-Z essentially is saying hey if you're going to uh bring this case this sounds like a criminal complaint I dare you basically to go file a criminal complaint and what's interesting too is that according to the complaint they explained the plaintiffs explained the reason that they decided [1703.64s] to name Jay-Z was allegedly Jay-Z had pushed back on the filing of this complaint so it's almost like a kind of hey if you're going to push us we're going to name you in this complaint instead of just saying that you're celebrity a that's a little bit uh problematic because if he wasn't a party originally if he was just celebrity a and now the only difference is because Jay-Z pushed back it raises a question as to what exactly Jay-Z did as a party but that will all be worked out in [1733.72s] Discovery and talk about what does happen next then with all this well when you file a civil complaint in federal court the next steps are very clearly laid out in procedure but they're not that exciting the court will get together the parties get together they figure out a discovery plan and then months out the parties start exchanging Discovery paperwork documents and then months beyond that they start having depositions but in the Civil complaint context the opening Salvo is the filing of the pleading and then after that it's mostly quiet until we get to depositions [1763.84s] which are usually not in the public and then years from now in federal court maybe a year a year and a half then you get to trial all right Danny thanks as always in Paris the iconic notredam Cathedral is open again after that devastating fire back in 2019 yeah the pews of the Beloved Landmark were filled with worshippers yesterday as hundreds flocked to the cathedral for the first Sunday mass in five years NBC News correspondent Jay Gray joins us now from Paris with more on the inaugural mass and the

the iconic Church ravaged by fire five and a half years ago firefighters rushing in followed by construction teams Artisans craftmen and Architects close to 2,000 men and women many of those Heroes

perspective before the fire rraam was the most visited site in Europe with about 13 million a year they expect to see that many in the next 3 months here [1956.00s] wow oh my goodness that is just so neat to see J gr so awesome you're there thank you very much coming up it is a common ingredient in some of our favorite snacks and drinks now a controversial red food D closer than ever to a Nationwide band y next more on the move to remove artificial coloring from the food we buy you're watching Morning News Now [Music] we're back now with the growing questions about drone sightings over parts of New York and New Jersey while police are on a high tech hunt trying to [1987.72s] track them down NBC News correspondent George sis has the details the investigation into reports of small car-sized drones hovering over New York and New Jersey is deepening oh look it's slowing down authorities in Toms River New Jersey launching their own drone offensive for a closer look their eye in the sky capturing one of the drones in oce you're not targeting or going after them so to speak is there a methodology and reason why well right now we just want to identify what it is the way it was explained uh they're 2 feet bigger than our drones or two times [2019.24s] the size rather so they're about 4T and it looks like it's a fixed Wing type craft what concerns us mostly is that at this point nobody's seen any of these units taking off or Landing this is a significant threat uh to US National Security retired fourstar General and NBC News military analyst Barry mcaffrey tells NBC News there's good reason why local and federal agencies are treading carefully when you see something of this capacity you wonder why it would be needed what are they doing it implies a [2052.44s] heavy payload and a heavy payload would be either something dangerous a bomb but in this case surveillance of some Shore look what's back again same spot as last night meanwhile more sightings of the large drones continue to proliferate social media New Jersey resident Michael martiano capturing these images on Saturday coming right above my house the FBI not commenting on the Drone activity to NBC news but setting up a tip line for people to report any [2083.68s] sightings it's moving really fast now growing concern as the mystery in the sky continues George siss NBC News Toms River New Jersey the Food and Drug Administration says it may finally move to ban red diey number three yeah that's a synthetic coloring it's made from petroleum found in drinks snacks cereals candies on top of that the FDA is also looking at re-evaluating red dye number 40 in the last three years alone three states have either passed or introduced laws to ban certain artificial dieses citing [2114.92s] research that they can cause hyperactivity in children the FDA maintains food dyes are safe when used in ways recommended by the agency more on this let's bring in NBC News medical contributor Dr Kavita Patel Dr good to have you with us so red Dy number three It's Been Under Fire for quite some time now at least a decade what are people most worried about when it comes to this yeah Joe and Savannah I think the most the kind of most concerning things are some of the linkages to hyperactivity disorder there have been [2145.16s] studies in male rats that have early predisposition to cancer and I think overall just more concerning is that there's growing evidence that these color additives can cause harm especially in children where your brains are growing you don't deal with as much body mask that that can warrant a ban overall so Dr Patel what does the research say you just mentioned some of it some of the the things that were concerned about with rats and with children's brains but are there any definitive studies here on the positive or negative effects of red diey number three yeah so the FDA advisory committee [2176.28s] did look at a review of some of these kind of links between hyperactivity disorder artificial food dies Beyond red D and did see that there was what we call a causal relationship Savannah we talk about this a lot sometimes we do studies and we correlate things like you find something and you're not sure if the thing that you're talking about causes it in this case the advisory committee did say that upon review of many studies that they did see a causal link between exposure to color dies and hyperactivity in children in a general population so that you know it's it's it's that that's exactly where that I [2207.60s] think the kind of question now is that this is something that is most concerning that study by the way these kind of um back and forth between the advisory committees about these causal relationships is also one of the reasons that these reviews I think are constant and important and right now the FDA oversees 75% of the food supply but we don't actually have as much study into the harm after the food is out in the market so I think that added to these studies and kind of the advisory committees as well as what Europe and [2237.68s] California have done with Banning a number of these substances substances has led to I think some of the I think some of the kind of uh laws that you're seeing today and also some of the FDA kind of action that you're finally seeing yeah so I mean wh State's already taking action how long could it take to see a ban like this go into effect and just what would be the impact of a nationwide ban right so let's talk about what California did California did this last year but their effect won't go into put Place into 2027 that's because you need to give time for food manufacturers [2269.28s] to not only put l warnings into place labels into place but also to put substitutes that doesn't happen overnight Joe so I wouldn't expect anything that could be done this year or next year to actually take place for several years to give people that same amount of time but I want to just warn people red kind of red dyes and some of these other dieses that we're talking about might be very obvious in bright drinks or in candies that's what I thought I was surprised to learn that you can find this in everything from casseroles to kind of products that I wouldn't think had red dye like vegan meat products for example so it's in a [2300.96s] lot of things look at your labels until then and it'll take a lot of time to find substitutes for all those different products as well something like vegan meat products when you're probably in some cases doing that for a health step and they're still diet something like that all right Dr Patel thank you so much coming up is buying a home becoming a family affair more first-time home buyers are turning to their parents for help with the down payment we're going to unpack the trend and how it's impacting the market stay with us this is morning news [2332.40s] now we're back with some Financial headlines starting with the latest legal blow to Tik Tok presence here in America yes NBC's Bertha joins us with another news Bertha good morning hey good morning Joe Savannah yeah Tik Tok is vowing to appeal all the way to the Supreme Court after a federal appeals court upheld a law that could lead to the social media platform being banned here in the US the ruling on Friday would require Tik Tok to break ties with its chinab based parent company bite dance or be banned by mid [2363.44s] January that is part of a law that was passed by Congress X say Tik Tok will have to be solid which could be a big win for Rivals like rather will have to be sold rather that could be a big win for Rivals like Instagram YouTube and snap if users move to those apps president-elect uh Donald Trump uh who tried to ban Tik Tok during his first term said on the campaign trail that he is now against a ban and would work to save Tik Tok meantime Walmart is tying a [2396.64s] bow on the holiday season with some last minute

Christmas and that's [2429.68s] going to be both online and in stores include deep discounts on top brands across Tech Toys fashion home and beauty and apparently more Americans plan to tip this holiday season but the dollar amounts aren't expected to be any bigger than last year a new bank rate survey shows the average holiday tips will remain flat for four of six primary service providers housekeepers teachers child care and mail carriers while they're expected to be lower for landscapers and trash collectors among [2460.72s] those who tip their uh primary motivation is to say thank you followed by rewarding good service being generous and because it's expected we the survey like that our mail well I have to yeah right peer pressure they don't want to be the person on the Block it's a very nice thing to do this time it's always nice to say thank you exactly thank you thank you Bera well let's on your money so home prices are soaring right well new research on home ownership suggests many [2491.88s] firsttime buyers are turning into mom and dad for help the personal finance website bankrate.com found 26% of younger home buyers relied on family money like help from their parents to afford a down payment the average down payment for a first-time home buyer is $26,700 that's about 8% of the average home price joining us now to help put all this into perspective is Pierre deos he's managing partner at rer the boss they're a real estate firm here in New York good to have you with usks so talk about I mean just how big of a trend is [2522.88s] this right now is it something recent how long has it been happening so it's really picked up in the last 5 years because when you look at the market since the pandemic took place housing prices appreciated between 50 to 100% throughout the country so we've have an unequivocally an affordability crisis in America now the entry level buyer has to lean on their parents to provide some kind of assistance on down payment when we talking about your average down payment about 26,000 your medium home price in the country is roughly 425,000 and a lot of banks will require 10% down payment it takes majority of Americans [2554.56s] their lifetime to save that money so it is a huge problem what we have in the country let's talk about the impact here what does this do to the market why is this important so it's dri it's going to drive up pricing because now it's additional liquidity and I will tell you in the next 10 years we have the greatest transfer of wealth in US history that's going to take place there's about $84 trillion of wealth that's expected to be transferred the next decade what do people do when they inherit money they initially they used the first dollar to go buy a home so when you have a higher purchasing price power I really think that housing prices in the country only continue to [2585.84s] appreciate even after the astronomical level of appreciation we've seen so yeah let's look ahead any Market changes or regulatory changes on the horizon that that could change this trend in some way or another not at all um the only thing that could impact it so by gifting money generally is a gift tax due but in order to give the money taxfree you're able to utilize an estate tax exemption while you're alive so unless that that is taken out of the equation this trend continues and only grows so interesting to see does it [2615.96s] concern you at all that this happens in terms of other people who are trying to get into the market you know it's concerning in some ways affordability in general is concerning but I do you know I empathize with your entry-level buyer that if you have access to this ability to have additional Capital why not right like I mean it's such an undaunting task to enter the housing market the barrier to entry has gone up so significantly in The Last 5 Years I mean I'm actually concerned that the first-time home buyer will be axed out of the equation for good if something does not change yeah Pi deos really good information thanks [2647.00s] to see him coming up you could say they saw the sign Swedish 90s band Ace of Base is back together kind of yeah when we come back the new documentary about their meteoric rise to fame so don't turn around you're watching Morning News Now welcome back looks like baseball Superstar Juan Soo will be staying in New York but instead of wearing Yankee pin stripes he'll step right up and meet the Mets the Superstar free agent outfielder has reportedly agreed to a record 15-year [2678.76s] $765 million deal with the

with singles like the sign and all that she wants and now a new documentary is chronicling their path to fame NBC news entertainment [2740.96s] correspondent Chloe Mass sat down with two of the group's members to discuss the ups and downs of their [Music] Journey Ace of bases bright infectious sound helped to find pop in the early '90s with catchy hooks like all that she wants [Music] the group from gothamberg Sweden is a family affair consisting of siblings Jenny Lynn and Jonas and their childhood friend Ulf but despite this family's chart topping success they haven't sung [2772.24s] together in over 25 years is it possible to see the rest in the studio but Ace of Base is now back in the spotlight with a new three-part docu series streaming in the US on Via play and add-on on Amazon Prime video I think um the real story about as has never really been told what I wanted with the documentary is I wanted to tell the hardships but I also wanted to tell how to get whole again the intimate series featuring neverbe seen home video footage I did have like 200 hours of film material from the early 90s until [2804.60s] recent days showing how the group broke through in the US market with the help of Veteran music executive Clive Davis who insisted that the band add another single to their debut album Jonas came up with a great song the sign and when I heard that song I said wow even to the point said look for our territory I want to call the album The [Music] [2836.36s] Sign do you think that there would be an ace of Bas without Clive well uh not here in the states that wouldn't been the same at all he was amazing without him in the US I'm pretty convinced we would never reach number one not long after that meteor success including three Grammy nominations in 1995 sister Lynn stepped back from the spotlight and the original four members have not performed publicly since it's almost seems like she disappeared where is she now what is she up to I feel like so many of us want to know well she's [2867.96s] leaving she's leading her life and uh she says I want to be out of the eye I want to be out of the the attention and I say yeah fine in the wake of fellow 90s ban Oasis announcing their reunion tour there have been lots of questions as to whether Ace of Base would ever reunite they previously said they wouldn't Ace of B but is this new documentary a sign that Ace of Base could take the stage together once again I've been trying to push to make a reunion for the past 10 [2898.76s] years but it has to work as well and we have to be able to do a great performance for the for the fans that we can be proud of everybody's 50 and as I say the time they knock on my door I got it all prepared for now olol and Jenny are hoping that the new docu series will give their fans a taste of all that they [Music] want Chloe Moss NBC News New York now those songs will be in your [2930.12s] head all day long you're welcome that's going to do it for this hour of Morning News Now the news continues right now [Music] good Monday morning thanks for being with us I'm Savannah sers I'm Joe prior right now on Morning News Now president-elect Donald Trump's plan for America he detailed plans for his second stint in the white house with our own Kristen Welker on Meet the Press but is it your plan to deport [2961.96s] everyone who is here illegally over the next four years well I think you have to do it and it's a it's a very tough thing to do more from their extensive conversation including how Mr Trump responded to questions on",

Now the news continues right now [Music] good Monday morning thanks for being with us I'm Savannah sers I'm Joe prior right now on Morning News Now president-elect Donald Trump's plan for America he detailed plans for his second stint in the white house with our own Kristen Welker on Meet the Press but is it your plan to deport [2961.96s] everyone who is here illegally over the next four years well I think you have to do it and it's a it's a very tough thing to do more from their extensive conversation including how Mr Trump responded to questions on whether Americans will have to Shell out more money for those proposed tariffs on America's biggest trading partners also this morning historic scenes in Syria Rebels topple president Bashar al-assad's regime forcing him to flee the country reactions pouring in from leaders across [2993.72s] the globe as the nation enters an uncertain new chapter plus paris's iconic notron Cathedral rising from the ashes it officially reopened its doors over the weekend more than 5 years after that devastating fire we're going to bring you the remarkable inside story of its return to for and it's the end of the eras Taylor Swift taking one final bow on her record-breaking tour in Vancouver over the week and we're going to have all the news from her big farewell concerts where one familiar [3024.48s] Swifty was there all so in the audience that's me of course you were there I could have missed the last weekend look forward to hearing your time spent soaking how many were there this year or this last two years 149 total dates and you were at 148 I wish I so wish I was lucky I got to see it quite a few times that's good all right good for you we'll get to that in a little bit let's begin of course with our exclusive sit down with president-elect Trump in his first broadcast TV interview since winning reelection last month yeah Mr Trump [3056.24s] spoke with Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker where he laid out his vision for a second term in the White House and as Kristen reports the president-elect discussed his priorities for day one and Beyond which include tackling immigration as well as proposed tariffs on major US trading partners good day to you in our interview President elect Trump laid out a sweeping agenda for the next four years and his first 100 days in office he said he wants to focus on the economy the border and getting his nominees confirmed have you thought about your [3087.64s] message we began our conversation with president-elect Trump on the economy and his threat to impose tariffs on America's three biggest trading partners Mexico Canada and China which experts warn could lead to a surge in prices can you guarantee American families won't pay more I can't guarantee anything I can't guarantee tomorrow I'm a big believer in tariffs I think tariffs are the most beautiful word I think they're beautiful it's going to make us rich the president-elect is standing by one of [3118.40s] his key campaign promises saying he has no choice but to deport everyone who is illegally in the United States you've talked about prioritizing people who have criminal histories correct but is it your plan to deport everyone who is here illegally over the next four years well I think you have to do it and it's a it's a very tough thing to do it's um but you have to have you know you have rules regulations laws they came in illegally the president elect also vowed to end Birthright citizenship a right [3150.28s] that's guaranteed by the 14th Amendment we're going to end that because it's ridiculous Mr Trump did say he's open to finding a way to protect dreamers those brought illegally to the us as children and raised here I think we can work with the Democrats and work something out asked about members of the January 6 committee the president-elect argued they should be imprisoned without any evidence that they violated the law honestly they should go to jail so you think Liz Cheney should go to [3180.40s] jail for what they everyone on the committee you I think everybody on anybody that voted in favor are you going to direct your FBI director and your attorney general to send them to jail not at all I think that they'll have to look at that but I'm not going to I'm going to focus on drill baby drill in a statement Liz Cheney the Republican Vice chair of the January 6th committee denounced Mr Trump's threat as a quote assault on the rule of law and the foundations of of our Republic the President also said he is looking to pardon people convicted for their [3212.24s] actions on January 6th and you can watch my full interview with the president-elect on nbcnews.com back to you all right Kristen thank you let's turn now to Syria where many there are celebrating the stunning downfall of President Bashar al-assad and the Syrian government the Syrian leader fled to Russia over the weekend in the wake of a lightning fast twoe offensive by Rebel forces NBC News Chief foreign correspondent Richard angle has more from the Syrian capital of Damascus good morning I am now right in the center of Damascus in the main Square more than a [3244.48s] thousand people have come here to celebrate they've come from all around the country there's been a lot of celebratory gunfire and I'm standing right now on a symbol of what has happened here this was a government tank it was abandoned in the last minute as the Syrian government the Syrian Army this entire regime collapsed it is ultimately how all dictators go jubilant crowds tore down a statue of the now former president Bashar al-assad's father the founder of a dynasty that ruled Syria with an iron [3277.08s] fist for more than half a century we saw the same scenes as pictures of the Assad family were defaced at the border crossing where we entered Syria this morning from neighboring Lebanon we are now inside Syria we just crossed the border and you can see there are no controls anymore the government is gone there are Rebels gunman on the street the regime has collapsed and you notice that the second you enter this country the mood is celebratory and welcoming people are proud of this New Dawn and [3309.12s] still in disbelief that Assad is really gone as we drove to the capital we passed Boys on an abandoned government tank cheering horea Arabic for freedom in the end it was the army that sealed Assad's fate soldiers refused to fight they faded away and ran as the rebels led by islamists rolled into Damascus unopposed the rebels leader once an Al-Qaeda supporter and considered a terrorist by the US is promising moderation and to work for all syrians [3341.16s] he has ordered his forces to prevent looting and leave civilians unharmed and so far they appear to be doing that the Rebels first priority appears to be breaking into Syrian prisons to free thousands of political prisoners kept in horri conditions of torture and deprivation syrians are rumaging through Assad's empty palaces and seeing his lost life of privilege a video claims to show Assad's Fleet of luxury Vehicles sports cars SUVs and exotic Collectibles [3373.80s] he won't be needing them in Russia the Russian foreign Ministry confirmed Assad and his family arrived in Moscow given Asylum for humanitarian reasons Syria now has a New Hope new possibilities and significant challenges as the map of the Middle East is being redrawn by the hour all right our thanks to Richard Engle for that report closer to home The Manhunt is widening for the suspect Who police believe shot and killed United Healthcare CEO on a Midtown Manhattan sidewalk yeah over the weekend police [3403.88s] released two new surveillance pictures of a person of interest as they're calling them from inside and outside of a taxi capab and we're finding out more about what was inside the backpack that police recovered in Central Park that might belong to the gunman NBC Sam Brock has been following the story for us and has the latest from Midtown those two new photos are added to a growing list of visuals that the NYPD has released to the public as they try to find the person responsible for killing Brian Thompson who they now believe has slipped out of the city [3434.56s] police right now are still searching for the gunman's bike and Firearm but the recovery of a backpack could pave the way for critical Clues with a quickly expanding man hun still underway this morning the net is tightening and uh we're going to bring this person to Justice police have now released two new photos of a person of interest wanded for questioning in the Midtown murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson one shows a man wearing a black hooded jacket and surgical mask in the back seat of a taxi the other that [3466.84s] man on the sidewalk through the car window police say they're from the same taxi he took to the George Washington Bridge bus terminal shortly after the murder where the nyp says it has

Washington Bridge bus terminal shortly after the murder where the nyp says it has video of the man entering the bus Center Wednesday morning but not leaving we also have reason to believe that the person in question has left New York City investigators combing Central Park over the weekend with nypd's Elite scuba dive team scouring the lake according to two law enforcement sources for the firearm used in the murder after a gray [3497.96s] backpack was recovered in the Park Friday that police believe belong to the gunman three sources say a jacket was found inside though it's unclear if it's the same one warned by the shooter and two sources say investigators also found Monopoly money you look at it and you're like was some some purpose of that what like why Monopoly money detectives say DNA evidence is still being processed as for the potential that the shooter took a bus out of town the NYPD says they don't know which one he might have boarded some of the many destinations [3529.84s] listed on the Port Authorities website include Boston Buffalo Binghamton Philadelphia and Washington DC in the wake of the murder backlash against the insurance industry I don't think anyone should feel bad about this from a shooter lookalike contest in New York City to critical comments online as United Healthcare headquarters in Minnesota is now surrounded by temporary fencing and a police trailer the company says they're partnering with local law enforcement to ensure a safe work environment and reinforce Security in addition to that Scuba [3562.08s] search in Central Park a senior law enforcement official says the NYPD also conducted two other searches on Sunday near the GW Bridge and that bus Center one of them being for triy and park the other some local subway stations obviously neither one yielded a weapon we've also confirmed that Brian Thompson's Funeral is today and it's going to be a private service in Midtown Manhattan Sam Brock NBC News back to you Sam thank you well for more we are joined by NBC News National Security analyst and distinguished research fellow at the foreign policy Research Institute Clint Watts Clint good morning [3593.48s] thank you as always for joining us um so we're five days out from this shooting still waiting for police to publicly identify this person what do you make of the fact that at least we right now do not know the identity of this person this case is so different than a lot of them that we've seen in recent years where we're looking at a mass shoot or maybe someone who was done a crime who didn't go to such a links to really hide their way into the City and in terms of their reconnaissance and then in terms of their withdrawal so this shooter has done a lot of things to keep law [3624.48s] enforcement off of his Trail at the same point there is some key evidence there I think in this case we're getting more pictures by the day you're seeing NYPD working through all that video footage I wouldn't be surprised if there's more incrementally that they find the second thing that we are learning is their the motive right what's in the backpack what's uh left at the scene those things sort of speak to this ideology that's probably targeted against United Health and the CEO and then at the same point I think there are other things to look at which we haven't seen we haven't seen an [3654.60s] online presence we haven't seen a Manifesto uh those sorts of things very different from other cases that are out there it could be that law enforcement is much further along and they're just not disclosing that information to the public they don't want to set off anything that the shooter might use to evade capture taking everything into consideration we know so far are you surprised this is taking so long I am in the sense that we you know we have New York City has got more cameras just about the another London Singapore a couple places second uh all of that [3685.52s] Technic techological footage and everything Great Law Enforcement Partnerships with Federal still not a major breakthrough that we've seen so far so that is surprising but it also speaks to this individual they maybe uh kept out of public life they didn't have a social media presence uh went to Great steps they were in the city for 10 days you know doing reconnaissance probably other things we don't know how did he get the bike in New York City if he came in from out of town so there's still a lot of gaps there that I wouldn't be surprised if law enforcement closes in on fairly quickly you mentioned some of the um the things that Left Behind the [3716.60s] things that police have found some of them are are making some headlines raising some eyebrows kind of these bizarre details Monopoly money in this backpack that may have belonged to the suspect uh the things that were written on each round that that was found at the scene what do you make of some of the the kind of stranger details like that yeah it seemed like this shooter really wanted to leave a message and and he didn't leave any amb ambiguity remember at first there was talk about a contract killer potentially or something like that definitely doesn't seem like the case seems like it's very focused on the [3747.48s] insurance industry and you know really bringing it Forward sort of an ideological motive in this uh you know this could really spawn other sorts of attacks or it could be inspirational sadly for others in the online environment so all of these things quite concerning it wouldn't be surprised if further down the investigation other Clues like this emerge so looking at the bus situation now knowing that this person's probably not in New York City anymore could be any other number of places how do investigators tackle that when suddenly the map is just so much biger yeah I'm sure uh law enforcement is [3778.60s] taking the timeline back to try and see if there's any clues that they could use from their arrival in the city and then moving it forward there's a number of bus routes that come uh from that station but there are fewer than let's say Port Authority if that's the case they now try and map all of those out are there cameras at the destination of each of these cities can they start to make that matching up that's bringing law enforcement together that's where the FBI is critically important is the Nationwide uh federal law enforcement effort they can really put those things together much more quickly all right glint Watts Clinton thank you so much [3810.64s] time now for your forecast this morning millions are still feeling the effects from that massive Lake Effect snowstorm and there's actually more to come heavy rain is coming over here in the East and in parts of the South meteorologist Michelle Gman is here with the latest on all that weather Michelle good morning good morning guys yeah you'll need the umbrella the next couple of

go throughout today Pacific Northwest we're doing good Southwest as well uh nice and dry there by Wednesday most of the active weather will be in the west still uh we're going to have some colder air working in behind this system that's going to ramp up up that lake effect snow machine once again and we are looking at another significant event Wednesday night into Friday in [3871.96s] terms of lake effect snow otherwise on Wednesday notice all this heavy rain these are really bright colors kind of just showing us that we are looking at a soaking rain on Wednesday from New England all the way along the coast the Mid-Atlantic down to the southeast could see some thunderstorms on the warm end of the system on the colder end we're looking at the chance for some snow that's the interior parts of the Northeast the Appalachians into the Ohio Valley also the great lakes in the Upper Midwest chilly chilly behind this notice we have 20s and teens behind it and then rain and snow in the

after a tragic fire closed its doors but first after the break shocking new allegations swirling around rapper Jay-Z we're going to dig into them and how he's responding next welcome back let's get to the explosive new allegations against rapper and entrepreneur Jay-Z whose real name is Sean Carter a new civil lawsuit accuses [3995.84s] him of raping a 13-year-old girl with sha Diddy hommes ago both men are denying those claims NBC News senior legal correspondent Laura Jared is here with more on the details Laura good morning hey guys good morning to you ever since comes was indicted by federal prosecutors last fall these parties that he was known for hosting and which celebrities were there have been the subject of intense scrutiny but the blast radius around the star has been relatively contained until now this morning disturbing new claims [4026.72s] against music icon Jay-Z a civil lawsuit detailing sexual assault originally brought against his longtime friend sha Diddy comes now adding new allegations against the rapper whose real name is Shawn Carter claims both men deny the anonymous woman who was 13 at the time described in the law suit is being drugged and raped at an MTV vma's Afterparty she says Combs hosted in 2000 according to the suit she recalls accepting a drink from a waitress that made her feel woozy and light-headed [4058.68s] before she says she was raped by Jay-Z and then combs in a bedroom as an unnamed female celebrity watched Jay-Z swiftly issuing a statement Sunday calling the claims heinous and accusing the woman's attorney of trying to blackmail him suggesting the attorney had tried to see a settlement first adding quote I implore you to file a criminal complaint not a civil one whomever would commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away my heart and support goes out to the true victims in the world the billionaire who [4091.00s] is married to Megastar Beyonce saying he is heartbroken the couple will have to

Colmes pleaded not guilty to the charges and continues [4122.08s] to deny the allegations Busby has made against him in a string of civil lawsuits which comes' attorneys have dismissed as Shameless publicity stunts but this marks the first suit publicly naming another high profile celebrity now in a statement posted online Busby acknowledged sending Jay-Z a letter prior to filing this complaint we're talking about seeking a confidential mediation but says his client never demanded a penny from Jay-Z at the time she is now seeking an unspecified amount [4153.72s] in Damages guys well Laura 20 years it's a long time explain how a civil suit like this is even possible how you go about figuring something like this out after an allegic counter so much longer yeah I think people have trouble sort of getting their mind around how are you supposed to corroborate something from years ago the New York law that's on the books right now actually allows for this when somebody has been victimize as a minor New York actually makes a provision for that in these circumstances now whether you are able to come forward with enough evidence in court to actually have a jury to find him liable is a whole different story [4184.36s] but she's at least allowed to make the claim under that New York law and she had the two-year look back window that actually allows her to do this and it would actually expire this coming March and so time was running out for her to do this if she was going to come forward all right we know you'll stay on it for us Laura thank you so much yep International

kind of felt like [4369.44s] you you you really were experiencing opening up God's family into God's house the moment you step into the restored Notre D it's hard to believe the cathedral was nearly destroyed by fire oh my that that gaping hole that was the roof after the fire as you can see it's gone it's beautiful the walls the floors the pillars the artwork everything [4400.08s] painstakingly cleaned or rebuilt I mean one of the things it's most noticeable it is so much brighter all of it I was outside the cathedral in 2019 in the immediate aftermath of the fire this morning the fire is thankfully finally out as investigators continue to search for a cause the change over five short years hard to comprehend this is roughly where all of that burnt [4433.20s] debris that fell from the ceiling the metal that fell the glass all of that stuff was here just in front of the sanctuary as you can see now it's all gleaming while I was inside the cathedral a group of firefighters came for a tour they looked around silent humbled by what has become of what they sa that's the rooster that stood at top the Spire the flames warped [4465.68s] and nearly melted it but they didn't destroy it while highlighting its former glory visitors will notice new designs for the alar the baptismal and the future home of a Priceless Relic and this is where the crown of thorns is actually going to be when it arrives in just a few days of course the crown of thorns believed to be the crown worn by Jesus during the crucifixion we were [4495.84s] given special access to see restored areas of Notre Dam the public has not yet seen from there a one-of-a-kind view of the Rose Windows fully restored though the building is spotless there is some evidence of damage Left Behind the Flames were so intense that day that the lead roof here actually started to melt and drip into the cathedral if you look closely you can see in the right hand of Jesus Jesus there they left the lead [4526.96s] deliberately to remind everyone of what happened that day a poignant new symbol AS this ancient Cathedral is set to welcome Millions making the pilgrimage to experience its Newfound Glory and our thanks to Craig Melvin for that report and really that tour of notredam more events are planned for this week French officials expect up to 40,000 visitors every day wow we coming up the latest on a criminal trial that's captivating America after the break why [4558.04s] a judge dismissed a manslaughter charge against the man accused in the Chokehold death of a man on a New York Subway that's next stay with us welcome back jury deliberations are set to resume today after the judge overseeing the trial of Daniel Penny dismissed the manslaughter charge against him yeah penny a former Marine still faces a lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide in the Chokehold death of of Subway performer Jordan Neely for more let's bring in NBC News legal analyst Danny savalos Danny [4589.68s] good morning thank you for joining us on this so let's talk about the difference in these charges here what is that there between manslaughter and then this charge of criminally negligent homicide it comes down to awareness of risk creation when we're talking about manslaughter the defendant is aware that he's creating a substantial and unjustified risk when it comes to criminally negligent homicide instead it doesn't matter whether the government can prove that defendant knew what he was doing was risky as long as all of us from the outside looking in can say [4620.68s] objectively what he did was risky whether or not he was aware of it and that is a lesser charge because it's obviously easier to prove what we all think of someone's conduct as opposed to what was actually in his mind how he was aware or not aware of risk at the time of the the alleged crime so the manslaughter charge was dropped after jurors said that they were deadlocked how common is it to see a judge drop a charge like this so late in the trial and could this send any sort of message to the jurors or were the jurors sending [4651.96s] a message to the judge perhaps right what's controversial here is actually that the government the people decided to voluntarily dismiss that manslaughter charge once they realized that the jury was deadlocked and it gave them a strategic Advantage because now going into the weekend the judge essentially says to the jurors okay you have this harder charge the more difficult one to prove is now gone now you only have to deliberate on an easier burden appr proof for the government so instead of deciding this actual knowledge of the risky created now you only have to [4682.88s] decide whether or not what he did was criminally negligent irrespective of what was in his mind or what risk he perceived or didn't perceive and that is what the defense is complaining about they're concerned it could lead to what's called a compromised verdict which might give them an issue on appeal if penny is convicted of this lesser included charge could he with double jeopardy laws be tried again on Mansa on the line generally when it comes to mistrials if this was a complete mistrial then yes the government can retry that case they don't always do so that is a more political decision [4714.36s] whether or not now that they've gotten a test result back from a jury as to the strength of their case sometimes the government declines to retrive but in a high-profile case like this uh when it comes to saving facee for prosecutors and that's my biased defense attorney uh hat coming out uh then in all likelihood even if they get a full mistrial I I would see the uh Manhattan DA's office retrying this case all right Danny seos thank you as always in a landmark class action settlement lgbtq plus folks in New York who were denied fertility care [4745.04s] coverage from Etna are eligible to get paid back for the fertility treatment that they paid for out of pocket NBC News correspondent Mora Barrett has more for the first time ever lgbtq plus people in New York can get paid back for the costly fertility treatments that Etna one of the largest insurers in the country denied cover covering for years because of their sexual orientation a historic multi-million dollar class action settlement now also requires Etna to change the way it defines infertility to include protections for lgbtq plus [4777.32s] people who can't conceive children on their own a case that could impact hundreds of people in the state those who already used things like IUI and IVF or plan to in the future Emma goell a mother of three is the lead plaintiff lgbtq plus folks are as deserving of becoming parents as anyone else on this planet Etna is declining to comment right now there are at least a handful of other cases against major insurers like Blue Cross Blue Shield and United at the heart of every case the claim [4807.48s] that lgbtq plus people are discriminated against on the basis of sexual orientation with plaintiffs saying they're spending tens of thousands out of pocket for fertility treatments their insurers refus to cover according to court documents Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois says its policy is not discriminatory with we should note NBC News reached out to United and Blue Cross Blue Shield but we haven't heard back yet only 13 states require insurers to cover treatments for same-sex couples who can't conceive on their own but it's not that simple companies that have self-funded insurance policies where the [4839.40s] employer pays employee claims don't have to follow state law leaving many people confused about what coverage they're entitled to or not it is really uncomfortable sometimes to talk to your employer or your HR department about what benefits are offered especially when those benefits have to do with wanting to start a family Tera kwiki a labor and delivery nurse in Georgia says she was denied coverage for fertility treatments when she decided to start a family in 2021 I am a bit older so it's [4872.16s] it was going to be late in life pregnancies anyway um so to think that that was going to be pushed back even further definitely had me feeling that this might not happen for me she's now the mother to a one-year-old and the lead plaintiff in a class action suit against her insurer as a nurse I've always wanted to help other people so I feel like other people in this situation may not have realized the options that they [4904.24s] have or felt like they didn't have options none of these cases include protections for couples who would need to surrogate to undergo fertility treatment Corey briskin and Nicholas majino are trying to change that we introduced you to

cultural phenomenon welcome to the a tour the tour's final leg drawing an estimated average of 58,000 people per show with each van spending nearly $1,600 on tickets travel merch food and of course outfits sparkly bold and clever okay how about guilty as Sin the tradition of friendship bracelets inspired by a song lyric driving up bead sales at Michaels [5409.84s] by 300% in host cities part of a concert culture among swifties that celebrated togetherness what is it like to have your siblings with you you made me cry it's so special it's awesome I think Taylor really just brings so many people together so many families together Swift's thanking them for all the magic they made than you I want to thank every single one of you for being a part of the most thrilling chapter of my entire life to [5440.72s] dat my beloved AOS Force as for what's next for Taylor Swift the possibilities truly are endless some fans are speculating maybe we'll see another concert film documentary because we saw extra cam Cruise throughout the weekend inside the stadium but look I think one thing is for certain and it's that this tour has left an indelible Mark over the past as my friendship bracelet here says 149 shows do you have a favorite moment I was just going to say look I'm wearing [5471.44s] one of mine that says 10minute version which if you know what that means you know what that means um oh gosh a favorite moment you know what it was obviously Taylor and her performance is just incredible to see of certain favorite songs certain things you're hoping for for the secret songs but one of the things that I loved was even when I was in that audience like even at really crucial moments when you want to be paying attention to the concert swifties that were right behind us said to my friends and I who were there let us take a video of you you guys look so cute with your arms around each other like that like it's just so sweet and kind like just the atmosphere that has been created by fans as Taylor noted so [5502.40s] much it just really is something you and I Emily were talking throughout the weekend and when you were gathering that sound talking to fans out there you said the same thing like swifties are just so nice yeah absolutely and I think that's part of what makes us such a special experience is that people want to be there together not just with their friends and families but with people from all walks of life and Taylor Swift even alluded to that she said the fans the Traditions the friendliness that's what made this tour so special and how cool that we got to witness it no I know that we were there for the last week and [5532.48s] I love it so much and actually my favorite moment is the transition from don't blame me to look what you made me do since you asked when she merges those two songs Emily thank you so much safe travels home we'll see you back here see you I just wish I had invested in beads now my goodness 300% well there's so many weird little things like that from the tour that just had such an impact coming up the nominees are after the break which of your favorite flicks made the cut for Golden Globes Glory the nominations were just revealed this morning who better to break them all down then friend of the show pop culture Wiz Brian balazar he's with us live up [5565.08s] next hi Brian stay with us welcome back every year since 1927 Time Magazine careful we selects one person for the coveted title of person of the year the Annual issue features a group idea person or object that influences the culture for Better or For Worse this morning we found out the 10 contenders on this year's short list we're going to show you them here on your screen they range from politicians like vice president kamla Harris to royalty like the Princess of Wales to [5595.56s] Tech CEO and Trump supporter Elon Musk a few others on your screen Mark Zuckerberg Benjamin Netanyahu Jerome Powell so who will it be we'll be sure to bring you more details on that final pick when we find out on Thursday always a talker last year Taylor Swift Taylor Swift so we'll see if they go more serious this year or what they CH to do all right let's get to some breaking news in the entertainment world the nominees for the 82nd annual Golden Globe awards were just announced Let's Take a listen to some of the names the nominees for best performance by a male actor in Emotion picture musical or comedy are Jesse Eisenberg a [5628.52s] real pain Hugh Grant heretic Gabriel Lael Saturday night Jesse pens kinds of kindness and Glenn pow Hitman as you're seeing there the announcements were made by actors Morris Chestnut and also Mindy Kaling comedian Nikki Glazer will make Hollywood history as the first woman to solo host the event on January 5th that is so cool for more let's bring in entertainment journalist and pop culture expert and [5659.08s] our friend Brian Bazar Brian good morning happy Golden Globes nominees announcement day let's get right to it who's going into the war shows with the most nominations uh the biggest nominee and let me tell you what it looks like when you're doing this in the morning you've got paper you've got a computer in front of you you've got a pad trying to frantically take a vote or take a account Perez yeah exactly is a story of a Mexican drug lord who uh under goes gender affirming surgery to become a woman that is leading with 10 nominations of course you heard from Wicked obviously four nominations for [5689.48s] them including uh nominations for Ariana Grande and Cynthia arivo um and I know we like to talk about surprises and snubs but I think what's worth noting here is that in fact um director John T did not get nominated for direction of this film but other Nomine ninees that are very uh getting a lot of nominations conclave the papal uh story with Ray fines uh the brutalist um which we also talked about Emilia Perez brutalist is a post-war Thriller um story with Adrien broy um a lot of popular dramas then [5720.12s] some of the familiar faces like hacks in motion uh in television series with Hannah einbender and Jean Smart both receiving nominees um I'm kind of spouting all this because all the information is coming in I should probably let you talk but the the answer the short answer to your question is Amilia Perez received the most nominations with 10 we should remind folks the Golden Globes is sort of like everything because in the movies they deviate up between dramas and then the comedy musical which is usually not a comedy or a musical and then you also have the television categories and those are divvied up into dramas and and [5751.60s] comedies everything is there so that's why there's so much being thrown at Brian right now you I mean we we will ask about surprises and snubs and we have to digest all of it I was quickly trying to go through the list here I don't know if it was a surprise but Pamela Anderson is a Golden Globe nominee this year yes no I mean some people probably will consider it a surprise this is for the last show girl but in fact we've been seeing a lot of her lately and we've getting been getting a lot of hype about this film and this being uh Panela [5782.88s] Anderson's chance to really be her true authentic self we've seen her on red carpets doing that in this in the form of not wearing makeup on red carpets but really she's kind of been reborn as an actress as well and this is going to be a break Al and we're only beginning to hear the critical Acclaim for her performance in this movie Brian we mentioned the host Nikki Glazer last year's host it was Joe Koy I hate talking about this I just feel like it's so awkward when Joe's very nice I like Jo Jo last year he was kind of panned after his jokes fell flat in the room he said it's [5814.12s] a pretty tough gig what do we expect from this year's house Nikki Glazer I expect Nikki Glazer to absolutely kill it I think we this has been a great year for Nikki already you know she killed it at the Tom Brady roast she's been doing great roast for a long time she knows how to an analyze an audience and what they want from her she's an incredible comic and incredible writer she is going to be talked about she's also nominated for a Golden Globe for best comedy performance prepare yourself watch this space Nikki Glazer is going to kill it and be even bigger after this so when it comes to the [5845.36s] movies often the Golden Globes can be a predictor of what we see with the Oscars sometimes it's not sometimes the Hollywood Foreign Press goes on its own little tangent and doesn't really go the same path as everyone else but but do we have an idea right now when it comes to the top movies what the Oscar Front Runners really are right now what are the ones that could win the Globes and then could go on to get nominated and front runers for the Oscars I do I do think so I think we'll probably see affirmation in the form of the substance with Demi Moore who by the way is also [5876.08s] nominated for a Golden Globe um conclave absolutely brutalist and they're all going to be up there these are incredible dramas um it remains to be seen whether the last show",

Academia has long discussed this topic in-depth, such as using Regime Switching models for detection of abrupt market dislocation or structural changes. Popular techniques include modeling the underlying process as a Markov Process with certain distributions, and use such model to estimate the transition probability matrix. The premise of this approach is attractive: if we can apply different approaches based on different market regimes, then the modeling process can better reflect the reality. However, like any other model, the reliability of such model is not convincing. Personally, I've tried implementing some Regime-switch models proposed by academics and test their explanatory power for detecting market shifts (such as shift of cycles, volatility levels, etc), but the results are always disappointing. Can any fellow friends here share your opinions? Cheers.",

                  "content": "In the previous article on Hidden Markov Models it was shown how their application to index returns data could be used as a mechanism for discovering latent \"market regimes\". The returns of the S&P500 were analysed using the R statistical programming environment. It was seen that periods of differing volatility were detected, using both two-state and three-state models. In this article the Hidden Markov Model will be utilised within the QSTrader framework as a risk-managing market regime filter. It will disallow trades when higher volatility regimes are predicted. The hope is that by doing so it will eliminate unprofitable trades and possibly remove volatility from the strategy, thus increasing its Sharpe ratio. In order to achieve this some small code modifications to QSTrader were necessary, which have now been made live on the Github page. The market regime overlay will be paired with a simplistic short-term trend-following strategy, based on simple moving average crossover rules. The strategy itself is relatively unimportant for the purposes of this article, as the majority of the discussion will focus on implementing the risk management logic. QSTrader is written in Python, while the previous implementation of the Hidden Markov Model was carried out in R. Hence for the purposes of this article it is necessary to utilise a Python library that already implements a Hidden Markov Model. hmmlearn is such a library and it will be used here. Regime Detection with Hidden Markov Models If you are unfamiliar with Hidden Markov Models and/or are unaware of how they can be used as a risk management tool, it is worth taking a look at the following articles in the series: The first discusses the mathematical and statistical basis behind the model while the second article uses the depmixS4 R package to fit a HMM to S&P500 returns. Hidden Markov Models are a type of stochastic state-space model. They assume the existence of \"hidden\" or \"latent\" states that are not directly observable. These hidden states have an influence on values which are observable, known as the observations. One of the goals of the model is to ascertain the current state from the set of known observations. In quantitative trading this problem translates into having \"hidden\" or \"latent\" market regimes, such as changing regulatory environments, or periods of excess volatility. The observations in this case are the returns from a particular set of financial market data. The returns are indirectly influenced by the hidden market regimes. Fitting a Hidden Markov Model to the returns data allows prediction of new regime states, which can be used a risk management trading filter mechanism. The Trading Strategy The trading strategy for this article is exceedingly simple and is used because it can be well understood. The important issue is the risk management aspect, which will be given significantly more attention. The short-term trend following strategy is of the classic moving average crossover type. The rules are simple: At every bar calculate the 10-day and 30-day simple moving averages (SMA) If the 10-day SMA exceeds the 30-day SMA and the strategy is not invested, then go long If the 30-day SMA exceeds the 10-day SMA and the strategy is invested, then close the position This is not a particularly effective strategy with these parameters, especially on S&P500 index prices. It will not really achieve much in comparison to a buy-and-hold of the SPY ETF for the same period. However, when combined with a risk management trading filter it becomes more effective due to the potential of eliminating trades occuring in highly volatile periods, where such trend-following strategies can lose money. The risk management filter applied here works by training a Hidden Markov Model on S&P500 data from the 29th January 1993 (the earliest available data for SPY on Yahoo Finance) through to the 31st December 2004. This model is then serialised (via Python pickle) and utilised with a QSTrader RiskManager subclass. The risk manager checks, for every trade sent, whether the current state is a low volatility or high volatility regime. If volatility is low any long trades are let through and carried out. If volatility is high any open trades are closed out upon receipt of the closing signal, while any new potential long trades are cancelled before being allowed to pass through. This has the potential desired effect of eliminating trend-following trades in periods of high vol where they are likely to lose money due to incorrect identification of \"trend\". The backtest of this strategy is carried out from 1st January 2005 to 31st December 2014, without retraining the Hidden Markov Model along the way. In particular this means the HMM is being used out-of-sample and not on in-sample training data. Data In order to carry out this strategy it is necessary to have daily OHLCV pricing data for the SPY ETF ticker for the period covered by both the HMM training and the backtest: Ticker Name Period Link SPY SPDR S&P 500 ETF January 29th 1993 - 31st December 2014 Yahoo Finance This data will need to placed in the directory specified by the QSTrader settings file if you wish to replicate the results. Python Implementation Returns Calculation with QSTrader In order to carry out regime predictions using the Hidden Markov Model it is necessary to calculate and store the adjusted closing price returns of SPY. To date only the prices have been stored. The natural location to store the returns is in the PriceHandler subclass. However, QSTrader did not previously support this behaviour and so it has now been added as a feature. It was a relatively simple modification involving two minor changes. The first was to add a calc_adj_returns boolean flag to the initialisation of the class. If this is set to True then the adjusted returns would be calculated and stored, otherwise they would not be. In order to minimise impact on other client code the default is set to False . The second change overrides the \"virtual\" method _store_event found in the AbstractBarPriceHandler class with the following in the YahooDailyCsvBarPriceHandler subclass. The code checks if calc_adj_returns is equal to True . It stores the previous and current adjusted closing prices, modifying them with the PriceParser , calculates the percentage returns and then adds them to the adj_close_returns list. This list is later called by the RegimeHMMRiskManager in order to predict the current regime state: def _store_event(self, event): \"\"\" Store price event for closing price and adjusted closing price \"\"\" ticker = event.ticker # If the calc_adj_returns flag is True, then calculate # and store the full list of adjusted closing price # percentage returns in a list if self.calc_adj_returns: prev_adj_close = self.tickers[ticker][ \"adj_close\" ] / PriceParser.PRICE_MULTIPLIER cur_adj_close = event.adj_close_price / PriceParser.PRICE_MULTIPLIER self.tickers[ticker][ \"adj_close_ret\" ] = cur_adj_close / prev_adj_close - 1.0 self.adj_close_returns.append(self.tickers[ticker][\"adj_close_ret\"]) self.tickers[ticker][\"close\"] = event.close_price self.tickers[ticker][\"adj_close\"] = event.adj_close_price self.tickers[ticker][\"timestamp\"] = event.time This modification is already in the latest version of QSTrader, which (as always) can be found at the Github page. Regime Detection Implementation Attention will now turn towards the implementation of the regime filter and short-term trend-following strategy that will be used to carry out the backtest. There are four separate files required for this strategy to be carried out. The full listings of each are provided at the end of the article. This will allow straightforward replication of the results for those wishing to implement a similar method. The first file encompasses the fitting of a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model to a large period of the S&P500 returns. The second file contains the logic for carrying out the short-term trend-following. The third file provides the regime filtering of trades through a risk manager object. The final file ties all of these modules together into a backtest. Training the Hidden Markov Model Prior to the creation of a regime detection filter it is necessary to fit the Hidden Markov Model to a set of returns data. For this the Python hmmlearn library will be used. The API is exceedingly simple, which makes it straightforward to fit and store the model for later use. The first task is to import the necessary libraries. pickle is necessary to serialise the model for use in the regime detection risk manager. warnings is used to suppress the excessive deprecation warnings generated by Scikit-Learn, through API calls from hmmlearn. GaussianHMM is imported from hmmlearn forming the basis of the model. Matplotlib and Seaborn are imported to plot the in-sample hidden states, necessary for a \"sanity check\" on the models behaviour: # regime_hmm_train.py from __future__ import print_function import datetime import pickle import warnings from hmmlearn.hmm import GaussianHMM from matplotlib import cm, pyplot as plt from matplotlib.dates import YearLocator, MonthLocator import numpy as np import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns The obtain_prices_df function opens up the CSV file of the SPY data downloaded from Yahoo Finance into a Pandas DataFrame. It then calculates the percentage returns of the adjusted closing prices and truncates the ending date to the desired final training period. Calculating the percentage returns introduces NaN values into the DataFrame, which are then dropped in place: def obtain_prices_df(csv_filepath, end_date): \"\"\" Obtain the prices DataFrame from the CSV file, filter by the end date and calculate the percentage returns",

GaussianHMM is imported from hmmlearn forming the basis of the model. Matplotlib and Seaborn are imported to plot the in-sample hidden states, necessary for a \"sanity check\" on the models behaviour: # regime_hmm_train.py from __future__ import print_function import datetime import pickle import warnings from hmmlearn.hmm import GaussianHMM from matplotlib import cm, pyplot as plt from matplotlib.dates import YearLocator, MonthLocator import numpy as np import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns The obtain_prices_df function opens up the CSV file of the SPY data downloaded from Yahoo Finance into a Pandas DataFrame. It then calculates the percentage returns of the adjusted closing prices and truncates the ending date to the desired final training period. Calculating the percentage returns introduces NaN values into the DataFrame, which are then dropped in place: def obtain_prices_df(csv_filepath, end_date): \"\"\" Obtain the prices DataFrame from the CSV file, filter by the end date and calculate the percentage returns. \"\"\" df = pd.read_csv( csv_filepath, header=0, names=[ \"Date\", \"Open\", \"High\", \"Low\", \"Close\", \"Volume\", \"Adj Close\" ], index_col=\"Date\", parse_dates=True ) df[\"Returns\"] = df[\"Adj Close\"].pct_change() df = df[:end_date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")] df.dropna(inplace=True) return df The following function, plot_in_sample_hidden_states , is not strictly necessary for training purposes. It has been modified from the hmmlearn tutorial file found in the documentation. The code takes the model along with the prices DataFrame and creates a subplot, one plot for each hidden state generated by the model. Each subplot displays the adjusted closing price masked by that particular hidden state/regime. This is useful to see if the HMM is producing \"sane\" states: def plot_in_sample_hidden_states(hmm_model, df): \"\"\" Plot the adjusted closing prices masked by the in-sample hidden states as a mechanism to understand the market regimes. \"\"\" # Predict the hidden states array hidden_states = hmm_model.predict(rets) # Create the correctly formatted plot fig, axs = plt.subplots( hmm_model.n_components, sharex=True, sharey=True ) colours = cm.rainbow( np.linspace(0, 1, hmm_model.n_components) ) for i, (ax, colour) in enumerate(zip(axs, colours)): mask = hidden_states == i ax.plot_date( df.index[mask], df[\"Adj Close\"][mask], \".\", linestyle='none', c=colour ) ax.set_title(\"Hidden State #%s\" % i) ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(YearLocator()) ax.xaxis.set_minor_locator(MonthLocator()) ax.grid(True) plt.show() The output of this particular function is given below: It can be seen that the regime detection largely captures \"trending\" periods and highly volatile periods. In particular the majority of 2008 occurs in Hidden State #1. This script is tied together in the __main__ function. Firstly all warnings are ignored. Strictly speaking this is not best practice, but in this instance there are many deprecation warnings generated by Scikit-Learn that obscure the desired output of the script. Subsequently the CSV file is opened and the rets variable is created using the np.column_stack command. This is because hmmlearn requires a matrix of series objects, despite the fact that this is a univariate model (it only acts upon the returns themselves). Using NumPy in this manner puts it into the correct format. The GaussianHMM object requires specification of the number of states through the n_components parameter. Two states are used in this article, but three could also be tested easily. A full covariance matrix is used, rather than a diagonal version. The number of iterations used in the Expectation-Maximisation algorithm is given by the n_iter parameter. The model is fitted and the score of the algorithm output. The hidden states masking the adjusted closing prices are plotted. Finally the model is pickled (serialised) to the pickle_path , ready to be used in the regime detection risk manager later in the article: if __name__ == \"__main__\": # Hides deprecation warnings for sklearn warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\") # Create the SPY dataframe from the Yahoo Finance CSV # and correctly format the returns for use in the HMM csv_filepath = \"/path/to/your/data/SPY.csv\" pickle_path = \"/path/to/your/model/hmm_model_spy.pkl\" end_date = datetime.datetime(2004, 12, 31) spy = obtain_prices_df(csv_filepath, end_date) rets = np.column_stack([spy[\"Returns\"]]) # Create the Gaussian Hidden markov Model and fit it # to the SPY returns data, outputting a score hmm_model = GaussianHMM( n_components=2, covariance_type=\"full\", n_iter=1000 ).fit(rets) print(\"Model Score:\", hmm_model.score(rets)) # Plot the in sample hidden states closing values plot_in_sample_hidden_states(hmm_model, spy) print(\"Pickling HMM model...\") pickle.dump(hmm_model, open(pickle_path, \"wb\")) print(\"...HMM model pickled.\") Short-Term Trend Following Strategy The next stage in the process is to create the Strategy class that encapsulates the short-term trend-following logic that will ultimately be filtered by the RiskManager module. As with all strategies developed within QSTrader it is necessary to import some specific classes, including the PriceParser , SignalEvent and AbstractStrategy base class. This is similar to many other strategies carried out on the site, so the reason for these imports will not be stressed: # regime_hmm_strategy.py from __future__ import print_function from collections import deque import numpy as np from qstrader.price_parser import PriceParser from qstrader.event import (SignalEvent, EventType) from qstrader.strategy.base import AbstractStrategy The MovingAverageCrossStrategy subclass is actually one of the examples found within the QSTrader examples directory. However it has been replicated here for completeness. The strategy uses two double-ended queues, found in the deque module, to provide rolling windows on the pricing data. This is to calculate the long and short simple moving averages that form the short-term trend-following logic: class MovingAverageCrossStrategy(AbstractStrategy): \"\"\" Requires: tickers - The list of ticker symbols events_queue - A handle to the system events queue short_window - Lookback period for short moving average long_window - Lookback period for long moving average \"\"\" def __init__( self, tickers, events_queue, base_quantity, short_window=10, long_window=30 ): self.tickers = tickers self.events_queue = events_queue self.base_quantity = base_quantity self.short_window = short_window self.long_window = long_window self.bars = 0 self.invested = False self.sw_bars = deque(maxlen=self.short_window) self.lw_bars = deque(maxlen=self.long_window) All QSTrader AbstractStrategy -derived subclasses use a calculate_signals method to generate SignalEvent objects. The method here firstly checks whether the event is an OHLCV bar. For instance, it could be a SentimentEvent (as in other strategies) and thus a check is required. The prices are appended to the deques in the correct manner, thus providing rolling windows over which to perform the SMA. If there are enough bars to perform the moving averages then they are both calculated. Once these values are present the trading rules described above are carried out. If the short window SMA exceeds the long window SMA, and the strategy is not already invested, then it generates a long position of base_quantity shares. If the long window SMA exceeds the short window SMA the position is closed if already invested: def calculate_signals(self, event): # Applies SMA to first ticker ticker = self.tickers[0] if event.type == EventType.BAR and event.ticker == ticker: # Add latest adjusted closing price to the # short and long window bars price = event.adj_close_price/PriceParser.PRICE_MULTIPLIER self.lw_bars.append(price) if self.bars > self.long_window - self.short_window: self.sw_bars.append(price) # Enough bars are present for trading if self.bars > self.long_window: # Calculate the simple moving averages short_sma = np.mean(self.sw_bars) long_sma = np.mean(self.lw_bars) # Trading signals based on moving average cross if short_sma > long_sma and not self.invested: print(\"LONG: %s\" % event.time) signal = SignalEvent(ticker, \"BOT\", self.base_quantity) self.events_queue.put(signal) self.invested = True elif short_sma < long_sma and self.invested: print(\"SHORT: %s\" % event.time) signal = SignalEvent(ticker, \"SLD\", self.base_quantity) self.events_queue.put(signal) self.invested = False self.bars += 1 Regime Detection Risk Manager The subclassed AbstractRiskManager object is the first major usage of risk management applied separately to a strategy on the site to date. As outlined above the goal of this object is to filter the short-term trend-following trades when in an undesirable high volatility regime",

                  "content": ". As outlined above the goal of this object is to filter the short-term trend-following trades when in an undesirable high volatility regime. All RiskManager subclasses require access to an OrderEvent as they have the power to eliminate, modify or create orders depending upon the risk constraints of the portfolio: # regime_hmm_risk_manager.py from __future__ import print_function import numpy as np from qstrader.event import OrderEvent from qstrader.price_parser import PriceParser from qstrader.risk_manager.base import AbstractRiskManager The RegimeHMMRiskManager simply requires access to the deserialised HMM model file. It also keeps track of whether the strategy is \"invested\" or not, since the Strategy object itself will have no knowledge of whether its signals have actually been executed: class RegimeHMMRiskManager(AbstractRiskManager): \"\"\" Utilises a previously fitted Hidden Markov Model as a regime detection mechanism. The risk manager ignores orders that occur during a non-desirable regime. It also accounts for the fact that a trade may straddle two separate regimes. If a close order is received in the undesirable regime, and the order is open, it will be closed, but no new orders are generated until the desirable regime is achieved. \"\"\" def __init__(self, hmm_model): self.hmm_model = hmm_model self.invested = False A helper method, determine_regime , uses the price_handler object and the sized_order event to obtain the full list of adjusted closing returns calculated by QSTrader (see the code in the previous section for details). It then uses the predict method of the GaussianHMM object to produce an array of predicted regime states. It takes the latest value and then uses this as the current \"hidden state\", or regime: def determine_regime(self, price_handler, sized_order): \"\"\" Determines the predicted regime by making a prediction on the adjusted closing returns from the price handler object and then taking the final entry integer as the \"hidden regime state\". \"\"\" returns = np.column_stack( [np.array(price_handler.adj_close_returns)] ) hidden_state = self.hmm_model.predict(returns)[-1] return hidden_state The refine_orders method is necessary on all AbstractRiskManager -derived subclasses. In this instance it calls the determine_regime method to find the regime state. It then creates the correct OrderEvent object, but crucially at this stage does not return it yet: def refine_orders(self, portfolio, sized_order): \"\"\" Uses the Hidden Markov Model with the percentage returns to predict the current regime, either 0 for desirable or 1 for undesirable. Long entry trades will only be carried out in regime 0, but closing trades are allowed in regime 1. \"\"\" # Determine the HMM predicted regime as an integer # equal to 0 (desirable) or 1 (undesirable) price_handler = portfolio.price_handler regime = self.determine_regime( price_handler, sized_order ) action = sized_order.action # Create the order event, irrespective of the regime. # It will only be returned if the correct conditions # are met below. order_event = OrderEvent( sized_order.ticker, sized_order.action, sized_order.quantity ) .. .. The latter half of the method is where the regime detection risk management logic is based. It consists of a conditional block that firstly checks which regime state has been identified. If it is the low volatility state #0 it checks to see if the order is a \"BOT\" or \"SLD\" action. If it is a \"BOT\" (long) order then it simply returns the OrderEvent and keeps track of the fact that it now has a long position open. If it is \"SLD\" (close) action then it closes the position if one is open, otherwise it cancels the order. If however the regime is predicted to be the high volatility state #1 then it also checks which action has occurred. It does not allow any long positions in this state. It only allows a close position to occur if a long position has previously been opened, otherwise it cancels it. This has the effect of never generating a new long position when in regime #1. However, a previously open long position can be closed in regime #1. An alternative approach might be to immediately close any open long position upon entering regime #1, although this is left as an exercise for the reader! .. .. # If in the desirable regime, let buy and sell orders # work as normal for a long-only trend following strategy if regime == 0: if action == \"BOT\": self.invested = True return [order_event] elif action == \"SLD\": if self.invested == True: self.invested = False return [order_event] else: return [] # If in the undesirable regime, do not allow any buy orders # and only let sold/close orders through if the strategy # is already invested (from a previous desirable regime) elif regime == 1: if action == \"BOT\": self.invested = False return [] elif action == \"SLD\": if self.invested == True: self.invested = False return [order_event] else: return [] This concludes the RegimeHMMRiskManager code. All that remains is to tie the above three scripts/modules together through a Backtest object. The full code for this script can be found, as with the rest of the modules, at the end of this article. In regime_hmm_backtest.py both an ExampleRiskManager and the RegimeHMMRiskManager are imported. This allows straightforward \"switching out\" of risk managers across backtests to see how the results change: # regime_hmm_backtest.py .. .. from qstrader.risk_manager.example import ExampleRiskManager .. .. from regime_hmm_strategy import MovingAverageCrossStrategy from regime_hmm_risk_manager import RegimeHMMRiskManager In the run function the first task is to specify the HMM model pickle path, necessary for deserialisation of the model. Subsequently the price handler is specified. Crucially the calc_adj_returns flag is set to true, which sets the price handler up to calculate and store the returns array. At this stage the MovingAverageCrossStrategy is instantiated with a short window of 10 days, a long window of 30 days and a base quantity of SPY shares of 10,000. Finally the hmm_model is deserialised through pickle and the risk_manager is instantiated. The rest of the script is extremely similar to other backtests carried out on the site, so the full code will only be outlined at the end of the article. It is straightforward to \"switch out\" risk managers by commenting the RegimeHMMRiskManager line, replacing it with the ExampleRiskManager line and then rerunning the backtest: def run(config, testing, tickers, filename): # Set up variables needed for backtest pickle_path = \"/path/to/your/model/hmm_model_spy.pkl\" .. .. # Use Yahoo Daily Price Handler start_date = datetime.datetime(2005, 1, 1) end_date = datetime.datetime(2014, 12, 31) price_handler = YahooDailyCsvBarPriceHandler( csv_dir, events_queue, tickers, start_date=start_date, end_date=end_date, calc_adj_returns=True ) # Use the Moving Average Crossover trading strategy base_quantity = 10000 strategy = MovingAverageCrossStrategy( tickers, events_queue, base_quantity, short_window=10, long_window=30 ) strategy = Strategies(strategy, DisplayStrategy()) .. .. # Use regime detection HMM position sizer hmm_model = pickle.load(open(pickle_path, \"rb\")) risk_manager = RegimeHMMRiskManager(hmm_model) # Use an example Risk Manager #risk_manager = ExampleRiskManager() To run the backtest it is necessary to open up the Terminal and type the following: $ python regime_hmm_backtest.py --tickers=SPY The truncated output is as follows: .. .. --------------------------------- Backtest complete.

No Regime Detection Filter Click the image for a larger view. The underlying strategy is designed to capture short-term trends in the SPY ETF.

The maximum daily drawdown is slightly larger than the benchmark, but it produces a slight increase in CAGR at 6.41% compared to 5.62%. In essence the strategy performs about as well as the buy-and-hold benchmark. This is to be expected given how it behaves. It is a lagged filter and, despite making 41 trades, does not necessarily avoid the large downward moves. The major question is whether a regime filter will improve the strategy or not. HMM Regime Detection Filter Click the image for a larger view. Note that this application of the regime filter is out-of-sample. That is, no returns data used within the backtest was used in the training of the Hidden Markov Model. The regime filter strategy produces rather different results. Most notably it reduces the strategy maximum daily drawdown to approximately 24% compared to that produced by the benchmark of approximately 56%",

Most notably it reduces the strategy maximum daily drawdown to approximately 24% compared to that produced by the benchmark of approximately 56%. This is a big reduction in \"risk\". However the Sharpe ratio doesn't increase too heavily at 0.48 because the strategy still endures a lot of associated volatility to obtain those returns. The CAGR does not see a vast improvement at 6.88% compared to 6.41% of the previous strategy but its risk has been reduced somewhat. Perhaps a more subtle issue is that the number of trades has been reduced from 41 to 31. While the trades eliminated were large downward moves (and thus beneficial) it does mean that the strategy is making less \"positively expected bets\" and so has less statistical validity. In addition the strategy did not trade at all from early 2008 to mid 2009. Thus the strategy effectively remained in drawdown from the previous high watermark through this period. The major benefit, of course, is that it did not lose money when many others would have! A production implementation of such a strategy would likely periodically retrain the Hidden Markov Model as the estimated state transition probabilities are very unlikely to be stationary. In essence, the HMM can only predict state transitions based on previous returns distributions it has seen. If the distribution changes (i.e. due to some new regulatory environment) then the model will need to be retrained to capture its behaviour.

This can result in different market regimes or periods of continuous similar market conditions. Financial market participants aim to detect these market regimes and their shifts to handle potential risks and make better-informed investment decisions. Different approaches exist allowing the classification of market regimes. Many practitioners or researchers categorise markets as \"boom\" or \"bust\" markets, while others categorise them based on volatility, such as high, low, and mid-volatility regimes. Another approach is to classify market conditions into \"risk on\" or \"risk off\" states based on the investors' appetite. Identification of market regimes is an unsupervised process, and there is a wide range of techniques that can help to determine the current market state based on historical market data. These techniques include statistical approaches, such as vector autoregression models and hidden Markov models, as well as machine learning approaches, like clustering models e.g., k-means, agglomerative clustering, and gaussian mixture models. In the scope of this blueprint article, we aim to identify normal (growth) or crash (rapid decline) market states for S&P 500 using several statistical and ML models, including gaussian HMM, k-means clustering, and gaussian mixture models. Additionally, we build a simple investment strategy based on the identified market states and compare that with the base \"Buy and Hold\" strategy of the same asset throughout the analysis period.",

                  "content": "This section begins with a brief overview of daily log-returns of the Lithuanian pension funds. Later, hidden Markov chain technique was used to detect crisis/no-crisis regimes in global financial markets (2007\u20132022). Third, future scenarios of pension funds are generated using stressed transition matrices and historical daily log-returns. Finally, different response (to the crisis) strategies are compared, and the trade-off is discussed. 3.1 Quick overview of pension fund results Since 2019, there exist 40 s pillar pension funds in Lithuania: 35 life-cycle funds that allocate asset based on participant\u2019s age and 5 asset preservation funds (herein noted by index T) that are designed for participants who have reached a retirement age and/or have chosen to receive periodic payments from the fund. In particular, life-cycle pension funds are arranged into the following birth-year groups: 1954\u20131960, 1961\u20131967, 1968\u20131974, 1975\u20131981, 1982\u20131988, 1989\u20131995 and 1996\u20132002 (herein, the two last digits will be used to denote the age group). All these funds are managed by five pension accumulation companies, specifically \u2019Allianz Lietuva gyvyb\u0117s draudimas\u2019 (Allianz), \u2019INVL Asset Management\u2019 (INVL), \u2019Luminor investiciju valdymas\u2019 (Luminor), \u2019SEB investiciju valdymas\u2019 (SEB), and \u2019Swedbank investiciju valdymas\u2019 (Swedbank). In the study, daily returns have been chosen as the main variable that represents the performance of the pension fund for the period between January 2019 and the end of August 2022 (see Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Distribution of returns of IInd pillar PFs. Manager is given in the legend, while the participant\u2019s birth-year is attributed to the title of image panel. The special case \u201cT\u201d stands for the asset preservation PFs Full size image Figure 1 draws our attention to the many extreme returns observed for all pension funds, with a heavier tail on a left side of the distribution. Obviously, this has been induced by COVID-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which started with a sudden shockwave around the world and shook financial markets around the world. Comparatively, the largest deviations observed for pension funds of young participants, namely from the 68\u201374 to 96\u201302 birth-year groups, could be explained by a higher allocation to equities in investment portfolio. However, some differences could be observed between managers. Specifically, LMNR funds demonstrated the lowest variation, except for the 54\u201360 birth-year group, while the highest uncertainty was observed for INVL and SWED funds. Surprisingly, conservative funds of birth-year groups 54\u201360 and asset-preserving funds (denoted with index T) also experienced a sharp drop, which is a result of extraordinarily volatility observed in the bond market. Table 1 summarises the pension fund market in terms of mean, standard deviation (StDev), minimum, maximum, skewness, kurtosis, value-at-risk (VaR), conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), maximum drawdown (MDD), average recovery time (ART), correlation between fund and MSCI (CorMSCI), and correlation between fund and BB EURO (CorBB). Additionally, the same empirical characteristics are given for indices as well. Table 1 Descriptive statistics of pension funds over January 2019\u2013August 2022 Full size table From Table 1, as expected, the funds for young participants exhibited a larger mean return comparatively, with the largest one observed for the Swedbank funds. The risk quantified using StDev, VaR and CVaR had a tendency to increase in line with a growing portion of equities in the portfolio, with the largest estimates determined for Swedbank as well. As such, among PACs, balanced risk-return performance could be observed for Luminor funds. However, the funds of older participants suffered high losses determined by negative skewness and kurtosis, which holds for all PACs. Maximum drawdown, MDD, is one of those characteristics that historically measures the maximum loss observed from a peak. As can be seen in the table, MDD for young participants ranges from 28 to 32%, while for older participants\u2014from 10 to 22%. Correspondingly, the average time needed to recover from the drawdown, named ART, shows that it typically requires, on average, 9 days for the funds of young participants to revert to the long-run mean. Surprisingly, a different tendency is observed for older participants\u2019 funds, where comparatively a long ART is observed for Luminor funds, while other funds in this group have been able to handle it more rapidly. The last two columns of Table 1 imply that the strongest correlation with the MSCI index is observed for the Swedbank and Luminor funds, and the weakest correlation has been determined for Allianz. For the index of BB EURO, the strongest relation is found, in general, for Luminor funds, where comparatively high correlation was determined for all asset-preserving funds. Visually, all possible correlations are shown in Fig. 13. Furthermore, the correlations between various performance measures of all pension funds analysed and market indices are provided in Fig. 14. 3.2 Detection of regimes in main world indices The sample period used in the analysis starts in January 2007 and ends in September 2022, covering the global financial crisis, the COVID-19 outbreak, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and other disturbances that caused abrupt price changes (see Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Returns of MSCI and BB EURO Full size image As evidenced in Fig. 2, both MSCI and BB EURO historically exhibited a clustering of volatility: volatility changes over time and tends to persist, determining periods of low and high volatility. In particular, it can be seen that there exist subperiods, when high/low volatility is observed for each index separately, and subperiods with differing volatility between indices. As such, a global market defined through MSCI and EURO BB is defined by a 4-state Markov regime-switching model, which was introduced in Sect. 2.1. Specifically, Fig. 3 illustrates the regime detected over sampled period. Fig. 3 Market regimes detected Full size image Figure 3 shows that the switch to Regime 3 is much more often observed in the first half of the observed period, except for the period of global financial crisis, while the other half of the period has been mainly observed in Regime 2 or 4, with a comparatively longer duration in Regime 1. Consequently, Fig. 4 presents the empirical characteristics of a particular regime. Fig. 4 Descriptive statistics of regimes for MSCI World and BB EURO indices Full size image In Fig. 4, The empirical characteristics for Regime 1 summarise normal market situation. The switch to Regime 2 particularly worsen the characteristics of the stock market represented by MSCI. It could be seen that the mean return becomes negative, which is accompanied by increased uncertainty in terms of StDev, Range, and Drawdown. Comparatively, the landscape of the bond market represented by EURO BB is not directly exposed to a short shock observed in the stock market. Similarly, the switch to Regime 3 resulted in a shock observed in the bond market, which is explained by a lower mean return and increased risk characteristics. In particular, the stress observed in the bond market slightly pushed stock prices up. Finally, Regime 4 represents a financial crisis observed in both the stock and bond markets. The black histogram represents the distribution of the historical data for each index. The colourful curve identifies the normal probability distribution under each regime, respectively. Once a certain regime is determined in the market, the performance results of the pension funds are conditioned by the regime, as outlined in Fig. 5. Here, each empirical distribution obtained under a particular regime has been used to generate a conditional density \\(b_j^k\\) introduced in Sect. 2.1. Fig. 5 Distribution of fund returns for a particular regime (from top: regime 1, regime 2, regime 3, regime 4) Full size image The comparison of the plots given in Fig. 5 reveals that the largest variation in returns with heavy tails is observed under regime 4, as it was expected. Regime 3 distinguishes from the others by the smallest variation in general and, more interestingly, a differing central tendency including also spread around it among pension accumulation companies, especially for the birth-year groups covering 61\u201367 and 96\u201302. The evidence shows that comparatively large positive and negative returns are quite expected under Regime 2, with a heavier left tail. To check correlations between log-returns of funds in different regimes, please refer to Fig. 16. To check correlations between various performance measures in different regimes please refer to Fig. 15. 3.3 Stress simulation The matrix of transition probabilities of different regimes observed in the market was determined over a historical period of 01/01/2007\u201313/09/2022",

                  "content": ". Once a certain regime is determined in the market, the performance results of the pension funds are conditioned by the regime, as outlined in Fig. 5. Here, each empirical distribution obtained under a particular regime has been used to generate a conditional density \\(b_j^k\\) introduced in Sect. 2.1. Fig. 5 Distribution of fund returns for a particular regime (from top: regime 1, regime 2, regime 3, regime 4) Full size image The comparison of the plots given in Fig. 5 reveals that the largest variation in returns with heavy tails is observed under regime 4, as it was expected. Regime 3 distinguishes from the others by the smallest variation in general and, more interestingly, a differing central tendency including also spread around it among pension accumulation companies, especially for the birth-year groups covering 61\u201367 and 96\u201302. The evidence shows that comparatively large positive and negative returns are quite expected under Regime 2, with a heavier left tail. To check correlations between log-returns of funds in different regimes, please refer to Fig. 16. To check correlations between various performance measures in different regimes please refer to Fig. 15. 3.3 Stress simulation The matrix of transition probabilities of different regimes observed in the market was determined over a historical period of 01/01/2007\u201313/09/2022. In particular, we obtain $$\\begin{aligned} P=\\begin{pmatrix} 0.9829 &{} 0.0083 &{} 0.0079 &{} 0.0008 \\\\ 0.0479 &{} 0.9368 &{} 0 &{} 0.0153 \\\\ 0.0410 &{} 0.0023 &{} 0.9408 &{} 0.0159 \\\\ 0 &{} 0.0104 &{} 0.0091 &{} 0.9804 \\\\ \\end{pmatrix} \\end{aligned}$$ Consequently, the probabilities of steady states estimated from historical data are given in Table 2. Table 2 Probabilities of steady states \\(\\pi _i, i=1,\\ldots ,4\\) observed historically Full size table Once transition probabilities have been found, we can check whether the sequence of regimes satisfies a Markovianity property by performing the \\(\\chi ^2\\) test. In particular, with a test probability p-value = 0.651 we conclude that the sequence follows the Markov property and we can proceed with steady states of the ergodic system (the hypothesis of irreducibility was not rejected). The mean First Passage Times (MFPT) of our identified regimes are as follows. $$\\begin{aligned} m=\\begin{pmatrix} 0.00 &{} 126.86 &{}140.42&{} 251.41\\\\ 37.88 &{} 0.00 &{}154.59&{} 206.55\\\\ 42.94&{} 135.50 &{} 0.00 &{}198.88\\\\ 91.38 &{} 114.37 &{}133.58 &{} 0.00 \\end{pmatrix}. \\end{aligned}$$ The elements of this matrix may be interpreted as average time necessary to reach column state from the row state, e.g., \\(m_{12}=126.9\\) means that being in no-crisis regime in 126.9 days the process will appear in stock market crisis regime and in \\(m_{14}=251.4\\) days global crisis is expected. Moreover, if currently there is global crisis one just need to wait for \\(m_{41}=91\\) days to get back to \"normal\" regime. The simulation of stress follows the methodology given in Sect. 2.2. The stress level \\(k=2, 3, 4, 10, 20\\) and 50 has selected for the demonstration purposes. For instance, \\(\\times 2\\) means that worse regime is expected twice often than historically. As such, we get new transition probability matrices that describe the market behaviour under different levels of stress. $$\\begin{aligned} P_{\\times 2}= & {} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.9658&{} 0.0167&{} 0.0158&{} 0.0017\\\\ 0.0479&{} 0.9216&{} 0&{} 0.0305\\\\ 0.0410&{} 0.0023&{} 0.9248&{} 0.0319\\\\ 0&{} 0.0104&{} 0.0091 &{}0.9804\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad P_{\\times 3}=\\begin{pmatrix} 0.9487&{} 0.0250&{} 0.0238&{} 0.0025\\\\ 0.0479&{} 0.9063&{} 0&{} 0.0458\\\\ 0.0410&{} 0.0023&{} 0.9089&{} 0.0478\\\\ 0 &{}0.0104 &{}0.0091 &{}0.9804\\\\ \\end{pmatrix},\\\\ P_{\\times 4}= & {} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.9316&{} 0.0334&{} 0.0317&{} 0.0033\\\\ 0.0479&{} 0.8911&{} 0 &{} 0.0610\\\\ 0.0410&{} 0.0023&{} 0.8929&{} 0.0638\\\\ 0 &{} 0.0104&{} 0.0091&{} 0.9804\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad P_{\\times 10}=\\begin{pmatrix} 0.8290&{} 0.0834 &{}0.0792 &{}0.0083\\\\ 0.0479 &{}0.7996 &{}0 &{}0.1525\\\\ 0.0410 &{}0.0023 &{}0.7973 &{}0.1595\\\\ 0 &{}0.0104 &{}0.0091 &{}0.9804\\\\ \\end{pmatrix},\\\\ P_{\\times 20}= & {} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.6581 &{}0.1668&{} 0.1585&{} 0.0167\\\\ 0.0479&{} 0.6471&{} 0&{} 0.3050\\\\ 0.0410&{} 0.0023 &{}0.6378 &{}0.3189\\\\ 0 &{}0.0104 &{}0.0091 &{}0.9804\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad P_{\\times 50}=\\begin{pmatrix} 0.1451 &{}0.4170 &{}0.3962 &{}0.0417\\\\ 0.0479 &{}0.1895 &{}0 &{}0.7625\\\\ 0.0410 &{}0.0023 &{}0.1595 &{}0.7973\\\\ 0 &{}0.0104 &{}0.0091 &{}0.9804\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}. \\end{aligned}$$ Graph representation of transition matrices under different stress levels are provided in Fig. 17. Transition matrices above are used to generate sequences of regime changes in the market that already have been presented in Fig. 4.

Table 3 Probabilities of steady states \\(\\pi _i, i=1,\\ldots ,4\\) under different stress levels \\(\\times k\\) Full size table Comparing the values given in Tables 3 and 2 we can see that the probability to appear in Regime 4 increases quite drastically as the stress level increases. Furthermore, when the stress level is above 10, then the Regime 4 is highly expected (\\(\\pi >0.9\\)) and this state behaves like an absorbing state, that is, the global permanent financial crisis is observed in the market. Furthermore, from matrices of mean first passage times (MFPT) and duration of financial crisis (regime 4) it is possible to deduce what the stress level of a particular crisis is.

Moreover, if crisis will not end by 250 days (one year), then stress level will exceed 10. Similarly, we can estimate stress level of other crises in the past, e.g., financial crisis of 2008\u20132009 lasted for approx. Two years therefore stress level could exceed 25. 3.4 Strategy analysis In this subsection, strategies listed in Sect. 2.3 are verified for pension funds of Swedbank. The pension accumulation company has been selected for the demonstration purposes because of two main reasons. First, Swedbank holds the largest share (40%) of the IInd pillar Lithuanian PF market. Second, the historical correlation of Swedbank funds with MCSI World and BB EURO indices is among the largest ones. The idea for simulation of regimes with different stress levels for other pension accumulation companies would be the same. 3.4.1 Case A: Swedbank keeps the strategy unchanged Suppose Swedbank does not change portfolio allocations in funds despite the stress level expected. Next figures demonstrate the simulated trajectories of pension funds for 5 years ahead under different stress levels. Fig. 7 Simulated trajectories of cumulative log-returns of Swedbank 54\u201360 in case of strategy A Full size image From Figs. 7 and 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 in the Appendix we can see that the trend of the trajectories decreases as the stress level increases. This is not a surprise because probabilities of having more negative log-returns are much higher than of being positive. It is interesting to note that for all funds analysed, the trend remains positive if the stress level does not exceed 2. However, when stress level is above 3, the Swedbank funds tend to have negative cumulative log-returns. This statement is applied primarily to the most conservative funds (Swedbank 54\u201360 and Swedbank_T). In particular, the trend becomes negative for fund Swedbank 61\u201367 when stress level is above 10 and for funds Swedbank 68\u201374, Swedbank 89\u201395 and Swedbank 96\u201302 when stress level exceeds 50. Furthermore, the trend is always positive only in the case of two funds Swedbank 75\u201381 and Swedbank 82\u201388. These two funds could be treated as resilient to any stress. Additionaly, in the Appendix, Fig. 25 demonstrates the empirical densities of cumulative log-returns of Swedbank funds under different stress levels at time \\(T=1100\\). The statements above are supported by descriptive statistics of cumulative log-returns (see Table 4) at the end of the simulated period. Table 4 Stress influence to the statistics of simulated returns from 5000 trajectories at time \\(T=1100\\) for Strategy A Full size table From Fig. 4 we can deduce some important statements. First, the funds with lower share in equities sooner exhibit negative log-return. The standard deviation values show that a larger deviation is observed for the equity funds, which is quite expected. However, one can observe that the standard deviation within the same pension fund tends to increase when stress level doubles or triples, but its value becomes even lower compared to no stress for a severe stress level, i.e., not less than x10. Comparatively low values of skewness and kurtosis reveal the symmetric distribution of log-returns with no heavy-tails expected, which is observed in all cases. Risk measures such as VaR and CVaR indicate the expected loss, which becomes more severe with a higher stress level. In particular, for funds with larger share in equities, for example, birth-year groups ranging between 68\u201374 and 96\u201302, the loss in terms of VaR and CVaR is not expected. Finally, for cases where the Sharpe ratio is greater than 1, we could conclude that the risk was comparatively well managed, even some stress level was observed. This is not true for conservative funds, which demonstrate once again that investments in bonds only in the long term, with market crashes expected, would not ensure a positive return. 3.4.2 Case B: Swedbank changes its strategy to less conservative Here, we simulate regimes and change allocations of funds from their current to a little bit older group if crisis in stock markets is foretasted (regimes 2 or 4). From Figs. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 and 33 we can see that the trend of trajectories decreases when the stress level increases. This is not a surprise because probabilities of having more negative log-returns are much higher than of being positive. Similarly to Scenario A, the trend remains positive if the stress level does not exceed 2, when the stress level is above 3, then the trend of the most conservative funds (Swedbank 54\u201360 and Swedbank_T) becomes negative and for the Swedbank 61\u201367 when the stress level is above 10. Differently from scenario A, the trend becomes negative for Swedbank 68\u201374 fund when stress level is 20. However, for the Swedbank 75\u201381, the trend becomes negative when the stress level reaches 50. Moreover, the trend is always positive only in case of three Swedbank funds 82\u201388, 89\u201395, and 96\u201302. These funds could be treated as resilient to any stress. The statements above are supported by statistics of cumulative log-returns (see Table 5) at the end of 1100 days (5 years) and histograms (Fig. 34). 3.4.3 Case C: Swedbank changes its strategy to very conservative Here, we simulate regimes and change allocations of funds from their current to oldest group if a crisis in stock markets is foretasted (regime 2 or 4). From Figs. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 42 we can see that the trend of trajectories decreases as the stress level increases. Similarly to scenarios A and B, the trend remains positive if the stress level does not exceed 2, when the stress level is above 3, then the trend of the most conservative funds (Swedbank 54\u201360 and Swedbank_T) becomes negative. Unlike scenarios A and B, the trend becomes negative for Swedbank funds 61\u201367, 68\u201374, 75\u201381, and 82\u201388 when the stress level is above 10. Furthermore, the trend becomes negative even for Swedbank 89\u201395 and 96\u201302 funds (at stress levels \\(k \\ge 20\\)). In the case of Scenario C, none of the funds could be treated as resilient. The statements above are supported by statistics of cumulative log-returns (see Table 6) at the end of 1100 days (5 years) and histograms (Fig. 43). 3.4.4 Comparison of Strategies A, B and C In this subsection, we show how the choice of strategy during the shock period influences the expected results (simulated) of Swedbank pension funds under different levels of stress. Figure 8 shows the distributions of the returns of Swedbank pension funds. Fig. 8 Box-plots of simulated log-returns of Swedbank funds under different stress levels (comparison of Strategies A, B and C) Full size image From Fig. 8 we can clearly see that, independently of the birth-year group of the participant, Strategies B and C allow us to reduce the volatility of the returns",

The statements above are supported by statistics of cumulative log-returns (see Table 6) at the end of 1100 days (5 years) and histograms (Fig. 43). 3.4.4 Comparison of Strategies A, B and C In this subsection, we show how the choice of strategy during the shock period influences the expected results (simulated) of Swedbank pension funds under different levels of stress. Figure 8 shows the distributions of the returns of Swedbank pension funds. Fig. 8 Box-plots of simulated log-returns of Swedbank funds under different stress levels (comparison of Strategies A, B and C) Full size image From Fig. 8 we can clearly see that, independently of the birth-year group of the participant, Strategies B and C allow us to reduce the volatility of the returns. However, expected returns also decrease with some exceptions. What is really surprising (counterintuitive) from this figure is that for most of the funds, in case of small stress (\\(k\\le 3\\)) or no stress at all, reallocation to a more conservative fund, during crisis periods, increased expectation. To better explain this issue and show the balance between expected return and variability after 5 years, in Fig. 9 the Sharpe ratio values are provided. Fig. 9 Sharpe ratio of simulated Swedbank log-returns under different stress levels (comparison of Strategies A, B and C) Full size image Figure 9 allows us to compare the Sharpe ratio of simulated log-returns for Swedbank pension funds under different stress levels and different reaction Strategies A, B and C. We can clearly see that, depending on the stress level and birth-year group of the participant in the pension system, the Sharpe ratio varies much (from nearly 3 to nearly \\(-5\\)). For the oldest participants (Swedbank 54\u201360 and T), the Sharpe ratio does not depend on the choice of strategy, as the allocations are always the same. For these funds, performance is quite poor compared to other age groups (independently on stress level). Furthermore, if the stress level is higher than 2 (\\(k>2\\)), then the Sharpe ratio becomes negative. Therefore, we can state that very conservative investments during stressed periods are not the best choices. Furthermore, the younger the participant, the better the performance of its pension fund can be observed, which is not surprising if there is no crisis in the market. However, in the face of crisis, performance starts to decrease along with an increasing level of stress. What is counterintuitive is that if pension fund reallocates investments to a little bit more conservative during stress periods (Strategies B and C), then the performance increases significantly. Moreover, until some stress level (\\(k\\ge 10\\)) the performance can increase even if the allocations are switched to the most conservative level. Such behaviour can be explained in the following way: the variability of more conservative investment strategies is lower than that of less conservative funds, while the expectation is similar, and therefore the Sharpe ratio can increase. Furthermore, from Fig. 8 we have seen that when there is no stress or it is rather small (\\(k\\le 2\\)) the expectation of Strategies B and C can be even higher than that of Strategy A (doing nothing during a crisis), which is why the greater Sharpe ratio in Strategies B and C is not so surprising. In further figures (see Figs. 10, 11 and 12) the trade-off between different stress levels of three measures (mean, downside deviation (from 0) and Sharpe ratio) is shown when the pension fund manager switches investment from Strategy A to Strategy B and C. Fig. 10 Trade-off of mean comparing to Strategy A Full size image Figure 10 shows how the mean of cumulative log-returns changes when switching, under different stress levels, from existing allocations to more conservative funds is performed. It is difficult to generalise switching from A to B, as the trade-off is different for groups Swedbank 61\u201381 and Swedbank 82\u201302. For the first group, when the stress level is low (\\(k=0, 2,3\\)) the mean increases while in the case of higher stress (above 3) the mean decreases significantly. For the second group, the mean remains stable or even increases independently on stress level. However, in case of switching from strategy A to C, the following generalisation could be made: if a stress level is low, then expectation can increase (even more than in previously mentioned case A to B), while for higher stress levels mean decreases drastically. Fig. 11 Trade-off of downside deviation (from 0) comparing to Strategy A Full size image Figure 11 shows how the downward (downside from 0) deviation of the cumulative log-returns changes when switching, under different stress levels, from existing allocations to more conservative funds is performed. Differently from the mean, a negative trade-off of downside deviation is desirable, while positive signals a poor performance of investment. It is interesting that for most of the funds the downside deviation decreases quite significantly for small stress levels independently on strategies chosen, with an exception of Swedbank 75\u201395 in case A to B. Switching from A to B and from A to C mostly has different impact on trade-off (it is greater for A to C). Moreover, when a stress level increases the downside deviation can increase too, especially when k is above 20. A more clear trade-off is observed in the case of the Sharpe ratio (Fig. 12). Fig. 12 Trade-off of Sharpe ratio comparing to Strategy A Full size image Figure 12 shows how the Sharpe ratio of cumulative log-returns changes when switching, under different stress levels, from existing allocations to more conservative funds is performed. In case of switching from A to B strategies, the Sharpe ratio decreases for more conservative funds when the stress level increases. However, for Swedbank 82\u201302, the Sharpe ratio remains stable or even increases (insignificantly) independently of the stress level. Furthermore, in case of switching from A to C when a stress level is low, the change of Sharpe ratio is positive, however, for higher stress levels the decline is very large, for all funds. Additionally, in Appendix figures of trade-off of standard deviation (Fig. 44) and CVaR (Fig. 45) could be found when switching from Strategy A to B and C is performed. In summary (from this Section) we can state that when a crisis with low stress level is expected, it is wise to switch to the most conservative funds (Strategy C), this temporary will increase performance of investments. However, if a crisis with high level of stress is expected, it is wise to reduce volatility a little bit only (Strategy B), and this will keep efficiency at a similar (or even higher) level.",

To cope with this problem, firstly, this paper explores the approach of asset-liability management under the state-dependent risk aversion with only risky assets, which has been considered under a continuous-time Markov regime-switching setting. Next, based on this realistic modelling, an extended Hamilton-Jacob-Bellman (HJB) system has been necessarily established for solving the optimization problem of asset-liability management. It has been derived closed-form analytical expressions applied in the time-inconsistent investment with optimal control theory to see that happens to the optimal value of the function. Ultimately, numerical examples presented with comparisons of the analytical results under different market conditions are exposed to analyse numerically the developed mean variance asset liability management strategy. We find that our proposed model can explain the financial phenomena more effectively and accurately.",

However, empirical studies remain inconclusive regarding the nexus between oil price shocks and stock market returns. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to investigate the asymmetric impact of oil price shocks on stock returns in Nigeria.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nA two-stage Markov regime-switching approach is used to examine the asymmetric effects of three different structural oil shocks on stock returns. The oil shocks, which include oil supply shock, aggregate demand shock and oil-specific demand shock, are derived using structural vector autoregressive. Monthly data that spans the period between January 1990 and December 2018 are deployed for estimation.\n\n\nFindings\nThe linear estimation results show that only oil demand shock negatively and significantly affects the stock market returns. The Markov-switching regime results reveal that oil supply shock has a significant positive impact on the stock returns in a low-volatility state, whereas oil-specific demand shock negatively impacts the stock returns in a high-volatility state.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThere is a need for policymakers and investors to take cognizance of not only the positive outcomes of a relatively stable state of oil price but also the negative consequences of a high-volatility state when formulating policy and making investment decisions, respectively.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis study differs from other similar studies in Nigeria that have examined the asymmetric relationship between oil price shocks and stock market return by using a two-stage Markov regime-switching approach. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first attempt at using this methodology.",

We demonstrate it is possible and valuable to instead segment the market into more than two states not on the basis of volatility alone, but on a combined basis of volatility and trend, by combining the two-state MSR with an adap- tive moving average. A realistic trading framework is used to demonstrate that using two selected states from the four thus generated leads to better trading performance than traditional benchmarks, including the two-state MSR. In addition, the proposed model could serve as a label generator for machine learning tasks used in predicting \ufb01nancial regimes ex ante. Keywords Regime switching \u00b7 Technical analysis \u00b7 Markov model \u00b7 Trading 1 Introduction Financial markets are characterised by periods of evolving, low-volatility growth separated with a disruptive, high- volatility contractions. These regimes can be distinguished by signi\ufb01cant changes in asset returns, variances, and correlations, laying a groundwork for accurate detection techniques to be exploited by portfolio managers. One such detection technique is the Markov-switching regression model (MSR), introduced by Goldfeld & Quandt in 1973 [1], and later extended by Hamilton in 1989 [2] and Krolzig in 1997 [3], which has since become one of the most popular statistical methods to distinguish regime shifts in economics and \ufb01nance. However, the original two-state MSR model is not ideal, as two volatility states are insuf\ufb01cient to describe the complexities of market dynamics, and attempts to use a three- or higher state MSR can suffer from instability due to overly frequent regime switches [4], which in addition adversely impact portfolio returns by increasing the costs of trading. Furthermore, volatility by itself is not an infallible indicator of up- or down-trending markets. This paper improves on the current state of the art by combining the two-state MSR with the use of Kaufman\u2019s adaptive moving average (KAMA) [5], a method that is both stable (avoiding spurious regime shift detections) and accurate in locating the times of onset of regime switches. This combination generates four detected regimes based not on volatility alone, allowing, ultimately, a focus on those two market states with the greatest trading value, namely low-variance bullish and high-variance bearish, with trading results that will demonstrate the utility of the method. Improving on the Markov-Switching Regression Model 2 Background and Related Work 2.1 Two-State Markov-Switching Regression (MSR) Model The model to be described here is also known as the two-state Markov-switching dynamic regression model [3] and will be used throughout this paper as a fundamental part of the proposed regime-switching model, as well as (in its unenhanced version) one of the models used for performance comparison. The key to the MSR model\u2019s widespread use is its ability to incorporate observed characteristics of asset returns, such as asymmetries, autocorrelation, and volatility clustering [6]. This gives a way to separate the underlying process yt into St states (\u2019regimes\u2019) at times t \u2208{0, 1, ..., T }, where St \u2208{0, 1, ..., k}. Assuming the process yt refers to daily log returns ln rt, the model can be speci\ufb01ed as ln rt = \u00b5St + ln rt\u22121\u03b2St + \u03c3St\u01ebt, \u01ebt \u223cN(0, 1), (1) where \u00b5St is a state-dependent intercept, \u03b2St is a state-dependent coef\ufb01cient of lagged log returns, and \u03c3St is a state- dependent volatility [3]. With St \u2208{0, 1}, the governing dynamics of the underlying regime St are considered to follow a time-homogeneous Markov chain with \ufb01xed transition probabilities p, q \u2208[0, 1], \u0012 p 1 \u2212p 1 \u2212q q \u0013 where p = Pr(St = 0|St\u22121 = 0), q = Pr(St = 1|St\u22121 = 1). (2) If (\u03b4, 1\u2212\u03b4), with \u03b4 = Pr(St = 0) \u2208[0, 1], is the initial distribution of the Markov chain, then the model is completely speci\ufb01ed by the vector of parameters \u03b8 = (p, q, \u00b50, \u00b51, \u03b20, \u03b21, \u03c30, \u03c31, \u03b4) [4], and the estimation of \u03b8 is performed using Gibbs sampling, a type of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm described in [7]. If \u02c6\u03b8t denotes the estimate of \u03b8t , then for the two volatility states i \u2208{0, 1} the probabilities at time t \u2208{0, 1, ..., T } are given by pi t = Pr(St = i | ln rt; \u02c6\u03b8t), (3) in which St = 0 and St = 0 are the low and high volatility periods, respectively. pi t = Pr(St = i | ln rt; \u02c6\u03b8t) estimates the probability of a low (i = 0) or high (i = 1) volatility regime at time t; the higher the pi t, the more likely the process is persistent [4]. 2.2 Kaufman\u2019s Adaptive Moving Average (KAMA) The popularity of moving averages in trading strategies has prompted the creation of many different forms of these trend-following indicators. Some of these, such as simple moving averages, are better at smoothing the underlying price, and some, such as the zero-lag moving average, are better at minimising the lag, though these objectives cannot be achieved simultaneously. An adaptive moving average is, however, a speci\ufb01c class of moving average that attempts to do so, accounting for both trend and volatility factors to balance the smooth-lag issue [8]. (Note: From this point on, this paper will use the terms \u2019adaptive moving average\u2019, \u2019Kaufman\u2019s adaptive moving average\u2019, and the abbreviation \u2019KAMA\u2019 interchangeably.) The calculation of KAMA begins with determining an ef\ufb01ciency ratio (ER). The ER helps KAMA identify and adapt to ever-changing asset conditions by measuring the relative speed of price movement from one period to another. Assuming a daily frequency over time t \u2208{0, 1, ..., T } , the ER is de\ufb01ned by ERt = Mt Vt , (4) 2 Improving on the Markov-Switching Regression Model where Mt = Pt \u2212Pt\u2212n, Vt = n X i=1 |Pt \u2212Pt\u22121|, (5) and the momentum, Mt, is the change in closing price P over a period of length n (n-period) and the volatility, Vt, is the sum of the absolute value of daily closing price changes during an n-period. The ef\ufb01ciency ratio is constrained to 0 \u2264ER \u22641, such that a signi\ufb01cant price change as a proportion of low volatility will bring ER closer to 1, whereas a minor price change as a proportion of high volatility will yield an ER closer to 0. In other words, values close to 1 indicate a clearly de\ufb01ned trend in the price, whereas values nearing 0 indicate a consolidating and directionless market. The ER is embedded into KAMA\u2019s full formula as a part of its scaled smoothing coef\ufb01cient C. Considering again the daily frequency over time t \u2208{0, 1, ..., T }, the adaptive moving average is computed as KAMAt = KAMAt\u22121 + Ct(Pt \u2212KAMAt\u22121), (6) where the scaled smoothing coef\ufb01cient C over time t is expressed as Ct = [ERt(ks \u2212kl) + ks]2. (7) ks and kl in the above are smoothing constants relevant to a pair of different (short-term and long-term) simple moving averages over n period, calculated as ks = 2 ns + 1, kl = 2 nl + 1, (8) where ns and nl refer to shorter and longer time windows, respectively [5]. By combining the trending aspect of moving averages and the volatility factor of the ER, KAMA is able to both identify the global price trend and to accurately locate larger turning points. Thus, the potential trader would not need to so frequently switch position by buying and selling over local price swings [5]. MSR models also seek to determine the current state of the process with highest probability, in order to avoid switching states too often",

MSR models also seek to determine the current state of the process with highest probability, in order to avoid switching states too often. However, the main difference is that KAMA is primarily used to capture the global trend, bullish or bearish, whereas an MSR model detects disruptions in the variance of the underlying series. 2.3 Related Work Since they were \ufb01rst introduced by [1], MSR models have been discussed broadly in economic literature. Their performance has been analysed on macroeconomic variables, such as GDP [2] and in\ufb02ation [9], and they have been additionally applied to \ufb01nancial time series, such as equities [5] and foreign exchange [8]. The original, two-state MSR model is, however, not optimal, for reasons discussed in the Introduction. However, as also discussed previously, extension to three-state MSR models comes at a cost, since they are deemed unstable due to their tendency to shift regimes too frequently [4]. There are also concerns about potential over-\ufb01tting, as beyond the two-state model it is necessary to pre-estimate the optimal number of states, applying each version of the MSR model to each asset in order to \ufb01nd the optimal number of states [10], and hoping that the same optimal number of regimes will continue in the future. Finally, these multi-state MSR models do not solve the issue of overly frequent switches\u2014on the contrary, there is a high potential of increasing them. However, there is another potential solution to \ufb01nding a better partition of the market dynamics [11], which is to overlay the two-state model with moving averages, which method allows partitioning without frequent state switches, resulting in a four-state model in line with classic Wyckoff theory [12]. But although the model of [11] has been found to add value in equity strategies, it is constrained by the data required to calculate a necessary technical indicator, which requires period-high and -low prices. This limits application of the model to assets with a recorded history of high and low prices, even when their closing prices have been available for a much longer time. The work of this paper has taken inspiration from that of [11], replacing the custom Keltner Channels [13] in that model with KAMA, which does not require the recording of high and low prices; as will be seen in the Results section, the new model is both highly effective and applicable to a wide range of \ufb01nancial assets. 3 Improving on the Markov-Switching Regression Model 3 Data Setting up the proposed and benchmark models requires daily closing price data only. There are 56 assets in total, divided into four classes: equities (24 datasets), exchange rates (FX) (13 datasets), commodities (12 datasets), and \ufb01xed income (seven datasets). The choice of these assets is based on the extent of their use in the \ufb01nancial industry (for instance, major equity markets for stock indices, G10 countries for FX), to ensure there will be suf\ufb01cient liquidity to minimise the risk of market manipulation. In addition to the above-mentioned assets, a cash index is also used in the trading strategy detailed later in the Methodology section. The rationale behind the use here of a cash index stems from its low volatility and ever-rising trend. With the rare exception of periods of negative interest rates, such as after the \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008-2009, it is nearly impossible to lose whilst betting on cash in the longer term, which makes it a useful \u2019money-parking\u2019 tool. The start dates for the datasets vary, though are usually in the 1980s-1990s. The end dates are 26/03/2021 for equities, foreign exchange, commodities, and the cash index, and 08/01/2021 for \ufb01xed income. For each asset, that 85 % of the data closest to the start date is used for optimisation of the KAMA model, using procedures to be described below, while that 15 % of the data closest to the end date is used for out of sample testing. 4 Methodology This section is constructed as follows: \ufb01rst, the process of combining the two-state MSR model with KAMA is de- scribed. Second, the optimisation of the KAMA component within the combined model is outlined. Third, benchmark models used for performance comparison are brie\ufb02y discussed, and \ufb01nally the trading strategy, which assesses the tested models\u2019 abilities to separate regimes, is described. 4.1 Combining the Two-State MSR Model with KAMA The proposed regime-switching model is initiated with a two-state MSR model to detect high and low variance periods for each selected asset. Considering states St \u2208{0, 1}, and the 50 % level as a cut-off point for smoothed probabilities in the MSR model, this initial phase of model construction results in the separation: \u2022 Low variance regimes, de\ufb01ned as ones where the \ufb01ltered probability of state St = 0 is higher than 50 %. \u2022 High variance regimes, de\ufb01ned as ones where the \ufb01ltered probability of state St = 1 is higher than 50 %. KAMA then works as an overlay to divide these low and high volatility periods into bullish and bearish regimes. How- ever, its practical application also requires a mechanism to generate trading decisions, and for this purpose Kaufman\u2019s adaptive moving average is embedded within a construction called the \ufb01lter which generates a signal to enter or exit positions of interest. Over a t-day period, the \ufb01lter f is computed as ft = \u03b3\u03c3(KAMAt), where \u03c3(KAMAt) = v u u t( n X t=1 x2 t \u2212 Pn t=1 xt n ) , (9) is the standard deviation of the change in KAMA over n days, where n \u2264t , xt = KAMAt \u2212KAMAt\u22121, and the parameter \u03b3 is as discussed in the Background section. Calculating both KAMA and the \ufb01lter allows the construction of a strategy for trading in both bullish and bearish regimes: \u2022 Bullish, hence buy, when KAMA advances above its low over a prior period of n days by a value greater than the \ufb01lter. \u2022 Bearish, hence sell, when KAMA descends below its low over a prior period of n days by a value greater than the \ufb01lter Combining the above with the MSR model\u2019s results, the proposed regime-switching model, which we will refer to as the KAMA+MSR model, separates the underlying price series into four regimes: \u2022 Low variance and bullish when the \ufb01ltered probability of state St = 0 is higher than 50 %, and KAMA rises above its low over a prior period of n days by a value greater than the \ufb01lter. 4 Improving on the Markov-Switching Regression Model Table 1: Example grouping matrix; matrix entries denote the number of detected segments Cluster Low variance / bullish Low variance / bearish High variance / bullish High variance / bearish Cluster 1 1 0 0 0 Cluster 2 0 5 1 9 Cluster 3 0 0 2 0 Cluster 4 3 0 3 0 \u2022 Low variance and bearish when the \ufb01ltered probability of state St = 0 is higher than 50 %, and KAMA falls below its low over a prior period of n days by a value greater than the \ufb01lter. \u2022 High variance and bullish when the \ufb01ltered probability of state St = 1 is higher than 50 %, and KAMA rises above its low over a prior period of n days by a value greater than the \ufb01lter. \u2022 High variance and bearish when the \ufb01ltered probability of state St = 1 is higher than 50 %, and KAMA falls below its low over a prior period of n days by a value greater than the \ufb01lter. However, while all four regimes are of academic interest, not all are equally valuable for trading",

However, while all four regimes are of academic interest, not all are equally valuable for trading. The second and third are likely to be less useful because in the \ufb01rst of these cases the potential for pro\ufb01t is low, while in the second the risk is overly high. In preliminary experiments this was con\ufb01rmed by the low Sharpe ratios obtainable during these periods. Thus, in the trading results to be reported in Section 5, active trading is carried out only in the \ufb01rst and fourth of the above-listed regimes. 4.2 Optimisation of the KAMA Component of the Model The MSR component of the KAMA+MSR model does not require optimisation, as it is parameter-free. In contrast, the KAMA model requires the optimisation, over the training period that comprises the initial 85 % of the data, of \u03b8h = (n, ns, nl, \u03b3), that vector of parameters discussed in the Background section, where n is a moving window for the ef\ufb01ciency ratio ER and the \ufb01lter f, ns is a moving window for a short-term smoothing constant ks, nl is a moving window for a long-term smoothing constant kl, and \u03b3 is the control parameter in the \ufb01lter f term. Beginning with the initial vector of parameters \u03b8h, the algorithm constructs the proposed regime-switching model by overlaying the calculated KAMA on a two-state Markov-switching dynamic regression. Based on the outcome of this initial combination, the model splits each asset price into multiple periods (\u2019segments\u2019) which are classi\ufb01ed as being in one of the four regimes. Subsequently, the price slope (bullish vs. bearish) and log returns volatility (low vs. high variance) of each segment is computed, so that the optimised model\u2019s accuracy can be inspected. The parameter values are then adjusted to optimise performance during the training period. The test of meaningful separation of regimes is done using a method based on K-Means clustering [14], with a two- step walk-forward cross-validation and a custom scoring function. In order to implement cross-validation, the regime slope and volatility data is split into non-shuf\ufb02ed training and validation sets, whereby training is 50 % and 75 % of the training dataset in the \ufb01rst and second steps, respectively, and the consecutive 25 % of the training data are used for validation in both steps. The clustering ability of K-Means is employed on the sliced training sets to investigate whether the already re\ufb01ned regimes differ by slopes and volatilities. Given that this will be a four-state model, K- Means here assumes four clusters; the clustering algorithm additionally uses ten random initialisations of centroids, the same random seed for each model, and 300 maximum iterations per initialisation. The K-Means method then predicts clusters for the validation sets, and the generated predictions are contrasted with the model\u2019s initially chosen regime labels. To achieve this, the KAMA parameter optimisation algorithm uses a custom function called the misclassi\ufb01cation score. This scoring function groups clusters and regime labels into a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix in order to analyse the dominant number of detected segments (periods of time that fall into a given class) within each row and column, as in Table 1, and perform appropriate actions. The misclassi\ufb01cation score initially loops over rows to subtract the dominant number of segments from the row sum. Thus, in the example, in Clusters 1 and 3, since there is only one regime detected, the score is 0, which indicates lack of misclassi\ufb01cation within this cluster. However, in Cluster 2, there are 6 segments (out of 15) whose underlying slope and volatility characteristics do not resemble the dominant label, high variance and bearish, so the score is 6. In Cluster 4, there are two dominant labels, each mismatched (with respect to the other) with a score of 3, and we would in a case like this assign an overall score for the cluster of 3. The number of misclassi\ufb01cations per cluster is then summed up to indicate how many segments have been inaccurately labelled by the optimised model. The total number 5 Improving on the Markov-Switching Regression Model Table 2: Two-way (buy, sell) trading costs for each asset class Asset class Brokerage commissions (%) Bid-ask spread (%) Market impact (%) Total cost (%) Equities 0.14 0.13 0.53 0.8 Currencies 0 0.13 0 0.13 Commodities 0.14 0.13 0 0.27 Fixed income (ETFs) 0.14 0.13 0.53 0.8 is \ufb01nally divided by the length of the predicted dataset to form a ratio that can be compared between optimisation trials. Ideally, the \ufb01nal misclassi\ufb01cation score should equal 0, representing a perfect alignment between the K-Means discovered clusters and the proposed regime-switching model, though this degree of alignment is unlikely in practice and hence the optimisation algorithm is run 50 times to \ufb01nd the best-available vector of parameters \u03b8h for the training period, which are saved for use in the test period. 4.3 Benchmark Models The most obvious candidate as a benchmark is the two-state MSR model, being a component of the proposed KAMA+MSR model; comparison of MSR with the proposed model will reveal the value of the KAMA component. Initial experimentation determined that the model of [11], developed for equities, was not effective over the full range of asset classes considered in this work. In addition, this model requires knowledge of price highs and lows, and this data was not available for the full desired training period, that stretched back into the 1980s-1990s. This model was thus set aside. Additionally, while a three-state MSR model [15] was considered, it was found to be unstable (as discussed previously, multi-state MSR models typically have this associated dif\ufb01culty) but to be effective when its three states were reduced to two, by removing that state which had medium variance, and it was in this form included in the set of benchmark models. It should be noted that the two chosen benchmark models, like the MSR component of the proposed model, are parameter-free and hence do not need a training period parameter optimisation. 4.4 Implementing a Trading Strategy for Performance Testing The trading strategy requires an allocation of weights (adding to 100 %) between the asset and cash. These are optimised over the training period (earliest 85 % of the data, for each asset), by comparing the effectiveness of 1000 random weight allocations. Both annualised returns and the adjusted Sharpe ratio (ASR) [16] ASRt = MARt/\u03c3 MARt abs(MARt) (10) are calculated, on a per-segment basis. The adjusted Sharpe ratio is a valuable measure because it penalises negative variance especially strongly, while treating positive returns in the same manner as the standard Sharpe ratio. MARt in the above denotes mean excess annualised return over t days, \u03c3 is the annualised volatility, and abs(MARt) denotes mean excess annualised return over t days calculated from only positive excess returns. In this work, mean excess annualised returns equal mean annualised returns, as for simpli\ufb01cation the risk-free rate is set to 0. Inevitably, the asset returns are diminished by two-way transaction costs, i.e., ones incurred during both buying and selling. Table 2 lists the costs assumed in this work, as given in [17] (these values being considered in the industry to be conservative and useful estimates of costs): The differing costs between the classes of assets stem from the sizes of these markets and the potential in\ufb02uence a trader may have on them. For instance, it is dif\ufb01cult to have any signi\ufb01cant impact on foreign exchange, unless the trader is an intervening central bank. Additionally, since in this research raw currencies are traded, there are no brokerage commissions, and the only cost remaining is the bid-ask spread. In the case of commodities, the trader must account for brokerage fees, as well as the bid-ask spread on futures contracts",

The KAMA+MS-DR model is \ufb01nally compared to the benchmark models, in relation to both annualised returns and ASR, via a \u2019winning score ratio\u2019, WS, calculated as WS = (Zwinner \u2212Zrunner\u2212up) Zwinner (11) 6 Improving on the Markov-Switching Regression Model Table 3: Out-of-sample trading performance results, in which MSR 2S refers to the two-state MSR model, MSR 3S\u2014>2S to the three-state MSR model converted to two-state form, and KAMA+MSR to the regime detection model proposed in this work Average Winning Score Ratio: Highest Adjusted Sharpe Ratio MSR 2S MSR 3S\u2014>2S KAMA+MSR Equities 0.03 0.03 0.33 Commodities 0.25 0.24 0.13 FX 0.09 0.29 0.15 Fixed Income 0.06 0.01 0.22 Average Winning Score Ratio: Highest Weighted Annual Returns MSR 2S MSR 3S\u2014>2S KAMA+MSR Equities 0.08 0.03 0.10 Commodities 0.02 0.12 0.27 FX 0.22 0.02 0.19 Fixed Income 0.25 0.00 0.18 Combined Average Winning Score Ratio MSR 2S MSR 3S\u2014>2S KAMA+MSR Equities 0.11 0.06 0.43 Commodities 0.27 0.35 0.40 FX 0.31 0.31 0.35 Fixed Income 0.31 0.01 0.40 where Zwinner refers to the model with the highest annualised returns or adjusted Sharpe ratio, and Zrunner\u2212up refers to the second-best method. By computing the ratio in the above equation, it is possible not only to indicate the winner, but also by how much better it is relative to its closest opponent. After the winning score ratio has been obtained for both weighted annualised returns and the adjusted Sharpe ratio the two resulting ratios are combined as an average to reveal the model with the most effective risk-reward approach to detecting \ufb01nancial regimes. This combination is done as an equally weighted average; depending on an investor\u2019s preference either returns or Sharpe ratio could be more highly weighted, but a ratio of 1:1 is the most reasonable assumption in the absence of such a stated preference. 5 Results The results of using the KAMA+MSR and two benchmark regime detection models within the out-of-sample test periods (last 15 % of the data, for each asset considered) are presented in Table 5. It is clear that the proposed model performs strongly, in each of the two scoring metrics, for equities and \ufb01xed income. In the case of equities, the notably higher adjusted Sharpe ratio for KAMA+MSR points at a good balance between returns and volatility, which suggests a solid blend between the use of trend in predicting regime switches within KAMA and the use of variance for this purpose in Markov-switching regression. It is also worth pointing out that the proposed model achieves such results regardless of the equity region. Whether it is the USA, Europe, or Emerging Markets, the KAMA+MSR model seems to be resistant to both global and local shocks (though more indices, in particular from the Emerging Markets region, could strengthen this argument). Results for commodities and foreign exchange are more mixed, as can be seen from the table. However, after combining the two winning scores the KAMA+MSR model can be seen to have the overall best performance of those models tested, with an especially strong result, again, for equities and \ufb01xed income. 6 Discussion This paper presented an enhancement of the two-state Markov-switching regression model (MSR) by the addition of Kaufman\u2019s adaptive moving average (KAMA), resulting in a new model, which we term the KAMA+MSR model. Unlike multi-state MSR models, which seek only to subdivide variance (e.g., for a three-state MSR, into low, medium, and high variance), and which have proven both unstable and to result in large trading costs, KAMA+MSR seeks to instead identify regimes as combinations of variance and market trend (bull or bear), with an accurate timing of onset of each state, and without overly-frequent regime switches. The proposed model initially discovers four states, of which two combinations (low variance bullish and high variance bearish) were used actively in the trading strategy, with the remaining two (low variance bearish and high variance bullish) being periods in which it was deemed wisest to refrain from action. Due to the use of both variance and trend measures to detect regime switches in the KAMA+MSR model it proved able to outperform, on average, the comparison models in each asset class considered. However, we note 7 Improving on the Markov-Switching Regression Model that such an outcome could in principle be due to the strategy itself (asset vs. cash), and hence intend to implement alternative strategies in future work. There are three further ways in which the work of this paper could be extended. First, and most importantly, though the proposed model overall outperformed the benchmark models, this outperformance was less pronounced for foreign exchange and commodities, and it is possible that an alternative to Markov switching could do better in combination with KAMA in these cases. Second, as already mentioned, the current trading strategy discards two of the four discovered regimes as being likely to be unpro\ufb01table; however, more complex trading strategies, for example using derivatives-based hedging, could potentially make use of these regimes. Finally, and most importantly for future work, the KAMA+MSR model\u2019s ability to smoothly and accurate distinguish regimes will allow it to be used as a regime label generator for machine learning tasks in which the aim is to predict such regimes ex ante.

Moreover, Regime 1 is more volatile than Regime 2. The findings also show the crude oil market has a negative effect on the stock market in Regime 1, while it has a positive effect on the stock market in Regime 2. In addition, the authors can see this effect in Regime 1 more significantly in comparison to Regime 2. Furthermore, two-period lag of oil price decreases stock return in Regime 1, while it increases stock return in Regime 2.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis study aims to address the effect of oil market fluctuation on TSX index using Markov-switching approach and capture the nonlinearities between them. To the best of the author\u2019s knowledge, this is the first study to assess the effect of the oil market on TSX in different regimes using Markov-switching VAR model. Because Canada is the sixth-largest producer and exporter of oil in the world as well as the TSX as the Canada\u2019s main stock exchange is the tenth-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization, this paper\u2019s framework to analyze a nonlinear relationship between oil market and the stock market of Canada helps stock market players like policymakers, institutional investors and private investors to get a better understanding of the real world.",

Email: mmahmoudi@niu.edu Abstract This study aims to analyze the impact of the crude oil market on the Toronto Stock Exchange Index (TSX)c based on monthly data from 1970 to 2021 using Markov-switching vector autoregressive (MSI-VAR) model. The results indicate that TSX return contains two regimes, including: positive return (regime 1), when growth rate of stock index is positive; and negative return (regime 2), when growth rate of stock index is negative. Moreover, regime 1 is more volatile than regime 2. The findings also show the crude oil market has negative effect on the stock market in regime 1, while it has positive effect on the stock market in regime 2. In addition, we can see this effect in regime 1 more significantly in comparison to regime 2. Furthermore, two period lag of oil price decreases stock return in regime 1, while it increases stock return in regime 2. Keywords: Toronto Stock Exchange Index; crude oil market; Markov-switching VAR model 1. Introduction The impact of the financial crisis in 2007 on the global economy strongly proves the pivotal role of the stock market on the economy. The stock market through different financial instruments could provide diverse funding for companies and motive economic growth. These positive effects of the stock market in developed countries like Canada are more obvious. Canada is the world's second-largest country by total area, and its advanced economy is the ninth-largest in the world. Moreover, the country in question has ranked sixteenth among the countries with the highest nominal per-capita income and come out sixteenth in the Human Development Index around the world.1 As summarized in Table 1, market capitalization of listed domestic companies for Canada was 2.64 trillion dollars in 2020. The percent of market capitalization of listed domestic companies in the economy (160.7%) and stock traded in percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (61.5%) in 2020 shows the important role of the stock market in Canadian economy. In addition, the Toronto Stock Exchange Index (TSX) as the Canada\u2019s main stock exchange with 3.3 trillion total market capitalization of 1,640 listed companies up until August 2021 is the tenth-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization.2 1 See the latest Human Development Index ranking which is available at http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/latest-human-development-index- ranking 2 Visit the Toronto Stock Exchange website at https://www.tsx.com/listings/listing-with-us Table 1.Economic data of Canada in 2020 Quantity/Percent Rank in the World Macroeconomics GDP (constant 2010 trillion USD) 1.847 9 GDP growth (annual %) -5.4 Population 38,005,238 37 Population growth (annual %) 1.1 GDP per capita (constant 2010 USD) 48,617.09 20 GDP per capita growth (annual %) -6.6 Stock Market Market Capitalization of listed domestic companies (trillion USD) 2.64 6 Market Capitalization of listed domestic companies (% of GDP) 160.7 Total value of stocks traded (trillion USD) 1.01 Total value of stocks traded (% of GDP) 61.5 Listed domestic companies 3,922 Oil Market Crude Oil Export (billion USD) 47.6 6 Crude Oil Export (% of total value of Canada\u2019s exports) 12.2 Crude Oil Export (% of total value of exported crude oil in the World) 5.9 Note: This table summarized the main economic data of macroeconomics, stock market, and oil market of Canada in 2020 based on the Word Bank database The stock price index reveals the general trend/tendency of the stock market fluctuations. Indeed, the degree to which capital market is likely to succeed or fail is understood by way of the trend/tendency. Accordingly, in order for the portfolio managers and investors, who are dealing with stock trading and other financial assets in the market, to maintain and increase their value of portfolio, they need several factors influencing the stock price under discrepant economic conditions. Moreover, the returns of the stock exchange are under the influence of various factors. Oil price stands out among these affecting factors. Oil and its products are being used as the major source of energy in manufacturing processes across the world. Therefore, fluctuations in oil price can have a direct impact on the cost of production and company profitability. For example, while Gurrib (2021) and Prabheesh, Padhan, and Garg (2020) recently found that shocks to the number of crude oil price volatility impacted stocks during early COVID-19, Gurrib (2018), Gurrib (2019) and Lescaroux and Mignon (2008) find crude oil prices to be poor predictors in other markets. This is in line with Kinateder, Campbell, and Choudhury (2021) who compared correlations across different asset classes and found deteriorating relationships. Bakas and Triantafyllou (2020)found that uncertainty related to COVID-19 had a negative impact on crude oil. Oil is the most vital source of profit for oil exporting countries like Canada, Iran, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, which is why, its price and fluctuations can influence the natural sector and the capital market Mahmoudi (2021). Based on Table 1, more than 12 percent of total value of Canada\u2019s exports was crude oil in 2020, so that the biggest export products by value of Canada were crude oil. In addition, Canada exported 47.6 billion dollars crude oil in 2020, which was 5.9 percent of total value of exported crude oil in the World. Canada is the sixth-largest producer and exporter of oil in the world. Even though some studies recommend that Canada needs to invest in new sources of energy like wave energy, solar energy, and wind energy in order to reduce the Canadian economy's dependence on oil revenue, therefore, in this situation oil market fluctuations have less negative effect on the economy. (Ghaneei and Mahmoudi 2021) All in all, the oil market plays a pivotal role in the economics of Canada. In addition, nowadays stock markets have inevitable role in growth economics of developed country such as Canada. Because of these issues we want to analyze the effect of oil market on stock market in Canada. In this paper, we use a Markov-switching var model to examine this relationship. First, we introduce some important papers, which use different Markov-switching models, to analyze the relationship between oil price and the stock market. Then, we use data and run the MSI-VAR model to find the best fitted model to show the relation between TSX and West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil (WTI). Finally, we discuss main results and provide conclusion. 2. Literature Review Among the existing models employed in computational economics and econometric time-series analysis regime switching models have proved the most preferable. These models, for the most part, consist in a two-regime pattern with a state process which determines, in each period, the occurrence of one of the regimes. This state process, which is bivalued, frequently uses Markov Chain as an example to be modeled upon. Hamilton (1988) opted for this category of Markov-switching in the mean to carry out the Autoregressive model. In Hamilton (1989) , a two-state Markov-switching model in which the mean growth rate of Gross national product (GNP) is subject to regime switching was specified, where the errors followed a regime-invariant AR(4) process. The Hamilton method was taken up by Kim (1994) and became the subject of a more detailed analysis. Markov -switching was classified more generally, on the part of various authors, in the category of such models as regression models and volatility models. Filardo (1994) used an MSAR(4) switching mean model to simulate the log growth rate of industrial production (DLOGIP). He used The log growth rate, which was derived from the Composite Index of Eleven Leading Indicators (DLOGIDX), was made use of by him to serve as a business-cycle predictor.Krolzig (2000) studied the common business cycle of six Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries across four continents by using Markov-switching Vector Autoregressions (MSVAR). Moreover, various statistical characteristics of the Markov-switching model have been analyzed by Garcia (1998), Timmermann (2000), Cho and White (2007) . On the nature of the link formed between the oil market and the stock market in various countries. Park and Ratti (2008) conducted a study in the USA and thirteen other developed countries in which they investigated the degree to which fluctuations in oil market price influenced such pivotal financial factors as stock prices. The result revealed that there, statistically, existed a significant correlation between the fluctuation in oil price and stock index",

The result revealed that there, statistically, existed a significant correlation between the fluctuation in oil price and stock index. Nevertheless, to determine the type of the correlation much hinges upon the fact whether the countries in question are oil exporters or importers. In a study Fayyad and Daly (2011) examined, comparatively, the impact the oil prices shocks exerted on the stock profits in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)3 countries, the United States, and the United Kingdom. They found that the rise in oil price during the global crisis increased the predictive power of oil prices on the stock market. 3 Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is a political and economic union that consists of the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and Oman. For more information visit https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/gcc/overview#1 Moreover, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and the UK are among the countries whose stock markets showed more sensitivity to the shocks. Hussin et al. (2013) conducted an in-depth analysis of the link between the strategic goods, such as gold price and oil price, and the stock market in the context of Malaysia by making use of such models as Vector Auto Regression (VAR), Correlation Analysis, Granger, Causality Test, Impulse Response Function (IRF) and Variance Decomposition (VDC). The result demonstrated that, in the long run, stock profits do not form an integrated relationship with the strategic goods. Furthermore, the Granger causality model shed light on the fact that in Malaysia, of all the strategic goods, only oil price variables will have impact on stock returns in the short run. Balcilar, Gupta, and Miller (2015) conducted a comprehensive analysis in the USA spanning more than a half a century (monthly data from late 1950s to early 2010s) to study the non-linear relationship between oil price and stock market price using a MS-VEC model. The result revealed that there had been a model of two regimes in effect that splits the sample into two regimes of high- and low-quality pivoting around the variance-covariance matrix of oil and stock prices. Moreover, stock prices and oil price shocks have negative correlation in the high-volatility regime, while there is no relationship between them in the low-volatility regime. 3.

It should be noted that, MSM and MSI models are different. The rapid leap of the observed time series vector onto a new level is brought about by the dynamic response to the regime shift in the mean \uf06d(\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc95). On the other hand, a regime shift in the intercept term \uf06e(\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc95) cause a dynamic response which is quite the same as a comparable shock in the white noise series \ud835\udc96\ud835\udc95.

DATA In this study we use monthly data for TSX from January 1970 to May 2021. Moreover, so as to analyze the effect of oil prices on the stock market we use monthly data of closing spot prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil from January 1970 to May 2021. WTI serves as one of the main pricing references for light crude oil in the United States as well as it is a benchmark crude oil for the North American market.4 The data for TSX is obtained from Statistics Canada5 and the data for WTI is sourced from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).6 Since several important oil price shock like 1973 and 1979 oil crisis, 1990 oil price shock, 2000s energy crisis, 2007-2008 financial crisis, 2020 Russia\u2013 4 Based on several analysis the best proxy for Western Canada Select (WCS) is WTI. Since, there is limited dataset for WCS price, we use WTI price instead.

Saudi Arabia oil price war, and Covid-19 pandemic happened during January 1970 to May 2021, this range of data helps us to get a comprehensive understanding regarding the impact of oil price shocks on the Canadian stock market CLAYTON (2015) Some of the main statistics of data are described in Table 3. The mean and standard deviation of TSX are 6807.55 and 5234.50 respectively. The maximum index was 19730.99, which was reported in May 2021, and the minimum was 810.78, which was reported in June 1970. However, the WTI has experienced less volatility. The mean and standard deviation of WTI are 36.32 and 27.59 respectively. The minimum quantity was 3.31 which was reported in July 1970, and the maximum quantity was 133.88 which was reported in June 2008.

The results shows that variables are non-stationary in the natural log level and stationery in the return level. The value in parentheses represent p-value. Next, we wanted to recognize a long-run relationship between our return variables. In order to test cointegration in our data we should first find optimal lag. We ran the VAR model to find optimal lag. Vector autoregression (VAR) is a stochastic process model used to comprehend the linear interconnections among various time series. The univariate autoregressive model, known as AR model, is generalized via VAR models by means of introducing multiple evolving variables. For example VAR(p) Model is as follows: \ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc61= \ud835\udc4e+ \ud835\udc341\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc61\u22121 + \ud835\udc342\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc61\u22122+. . . +\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc5d+ \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc61 As it is clear from Table 5, based on the AIC criteria the optimal lag length is 2.

Based on different criteria, the optimal lag for our data is 2. After finding the optimal lag, we can run the cointegration test. The Johansen test is a test for evaluating cointegration and it allows to test more than one cointegrating relationship. Johansen test estimates the rank (r) of a given matrix of time series with a confidence level. Based on Table 6, our data set has two time series, hence, Johansen tests the null hypothesis of \ud835\udc5f= 0 in which there is no cointegration at all, and the null hypothesis of \ud835\udc5f\u22641 in which there is at most one cointegration relation. For \ud835\udc5f= 0, all of the test values are less than the critical values, so we could not reject the null hypothesis and there is no cointegration relation at all. For \ud835\udc5f\u22641, since none of the test values are greater than the critical values, the null hypothesis is rejected. Therefore, there is no cointegration relation between our variables.

The results of different tests show there is no cointegration relations between TSX and WTI. In absence of cointegration, the dependent variables diverge from any possible combination of the regressors. Therefore, running a VAR in levels is not reasonable. If certain or every single variable in a regression rate is I (1) therefore the regular statistical results might or might not be maintained. Spurious regression is a seminal example of when the regular statistical results are not maintained, while every single regressor is I (1) and not cointegrated as well. To avoid spurious regression and to seek nonlinearities in oil prices and the stock index relationship, we use Markov-switching VAR model. Based on the AIC criteria, the best model which fits the data is MSI(2)-VAR(2) model. For analyzing our data, we ran MSI(2)-VAR(2) model to identify TSX index\u2019s structure. As it is shown in Table 7, TSX index return has two regimes including positive return (regime 1), when the growth rate of stock index is positive, and negative return (regime 2), when the growth rate of stock index is negative.

The results show TSX index return has two regimes including positive return (regime 1) and negative return (regime 2). The values in parenthesis represent p-value. Then, we computed the transition probabilities of MSI(2)-VAR(2) Model for TSX index return. As it is shown in Table 8, \ud835\udc4311, which represents the probability of staying in regime 1 given that you are in regime 1, is 96%, as well as \ud835\udc4321, which indicates the coefficients for the transition from regime 2 into regime 1, is 17%.

Based on the AIC criteria, MSI(2)-VAR(2) Model is the best fitted model for examining the effect of the crude oil market on the stock market. According to Table 9 information, in regime 1 the expected return of TSX index increases monthly by 0.18 and the expected return of WTI price rises monthly by 0.57, while in regime 2 the expected return of TSX index decreases monthly by 0.02 and the expected return of WTI price rises by 0.003. In addition, the standard deviation in regime 1 is higher than regime 2, which indicates the TSX bull market is more volatile than the TSX bear market. Moreover, these results imply that there exists a negative correlation between oil price and stock return in regime 1, however, this relationship is positive in regime 2.

The results show that there exists a negative correlation between oil price and stock return in regime 1, however, this relationship is positive in regime 2. It means, increasing oil price decreases stock return in bull market, while increasing oil price increases stock return in bear market. Moreover, two period lag of oil price decreases the stock price in regime 1, while it increases the stock price in regime 2. In addition, regime 1 is more volatile than regime 2. The values in parenthesis represent standard error. Furthermore, the transition probabilities of MSI(2)-VAR(2) Model for the effect of oil market on Canadian Stock Index is shown in Table 10. Based on this information, when we consider the effect of oil prices, \ud835\udc4311, which represents the probability of staying in regime 1 given that you are in regime 1, is 96%, as well as \ud835\udc4321, which indicates the coefficients for the transition from regime 1 into regime 2, is 17%.

For example, \ud835\udc4311, which represents the probability of staying in regime 1 given that you are in regime 1, is 96%, as well as \ud835\udc4321, which indicates the coefficients for the transition from regime 1 into regime 2, is 17%. 6. Conclusion Based on the unit root test, all variables are non-stationary in the level and stationary in the first difference. Also, the cointegration test indicates that there is no long-run relation between the crude oil market and the stock index. Hence, we cannot run a VAR model because of the spurious regression. To avoid spurious regression and in order to examine the nonlinear relationship between oil prices and the stock index we used a Markov regime switching model. Based on the MSI(2)-VAR(2) model there are two regimes for the Canadian stock index including positive return (regime 1), when growth rate of stock index is positive, and negative return (regime 2), when growth rate of stock index is negative. Moreover, this model shows the crude oil market has positive effect on the stock market in both regimes, however, the oil price affects the stock market in regime 1 is more notably than regime 2. Furthermore, a two-period lag of oil price increases stock price in regime 1, while it decreases stock price in regime 2. 7.

Recognized as an important anti-climate change strategy by the world community, carbon trading policy plays a crucial role in both the environmental governance and economic green transition and is being implemented in a growing number of countries [2]. In the carbon market, similar to the role of prices in traditional financial markets, carbon allowance prices (CAP) also serve a basic market regulation function and make a significant influence on CO2 emissions by affecting the behavioral choices of market participants and energy consumption of the whole society [3-5]. The European carbon market, or what could also be called European carbon emissions trading system (EU-ETS), has become the world\u2019s largest and most mature carbon trading market since it was established in 2005 [6-7], and the performance of CAP in the EU-ETS Pol.

Keywords: China\u2019s carbon market, carbon allowance price, non-linear structure, regime transformation DOI: 10.15244/pjoes/172763 ONLINE PUBLICATION DATE: 2023-11-23 *e-mail: 2767528542@qq.com Wei J., Chen J. 1376 has long been a focus of scholarly research. Based on the analysis of the EU-ETS, available studies have explored the asset attributes of emission allowances [8] and found some obvious characteristics of emission allowance returns, such as skewness, excessive kurtosis, and fluctuation clusters [9-11]. Additionally, by extracting trading information in the EU-ETS, scholars have further revealed CAP changes\u2019 correlation with trading activity of market participants [12] and possible spillover effects to other parties [13]. China, as the number one manufacturing country and the contributor of the most CO2 emissions on the planet [14], has attached great importance to global climate change and environmental governance in recent years [15]. As a part of the action plan to achieve peak carbon by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060 [16], the carbon emissions trading system (ETS) has been implemented in the first seven pilot regions in China since 2011 [17] (Yellow marked area in Fig. 1), and since then provinces such as Fujian and Sichuan have also been included in China\u2019s carbon pilots over the following five years [18]. According to the distribution of the first batch of ETS pilot cities, it can be found that the selected cities have obvious regional specificities. As can be seen from Fig. 1, Beijing and Tianjin are the representative cities in North China, Guangdong and Shenzhen are the pioneers of carbon trading in South China, Shanghai accumulates experience for carbon trading in developed provinces in Fig. 1. The first batch of China\u2019s carbon trading pilot areas. Fig. 2. CAP fluctuation situation in seven pilot carbon markets (2013/6/19- 2023/3/24). Research on Carbon Allowance Price Non-Linear... 1377 East China in the future, and Hubei and Chongqing are the pilots of ETS in central and western China. Different economic and social conditions in these pilot regions, such as CO2 emission intensity, level of economic development, industrial structure, etc., also contribute to the heterogeneity in the evolution of CAP in different markets [19]. At the same time, due to the short time of establishing ETS in China, the lack of experience in the pilot regions, the immaturity of the market mechanism and the strong policy dependency, the fluctuation of CAP is very frequent [20]. Figs 2, 3 and 4 respectively show the average price, cumulative trading volume and cumulative turnover of carbon allowances traded since the opening of each ETS pilot. In the trading price section, as shown in Fig. 2, CAP in the seven carbon trading markets roughly experienced three stages: fluctuating decline (2013-2016), low and stable operation (2016-2020) and fluctuating rise (2020-2023), showing non-stationary and non-linear characteristics similar to the traditional financial time series [21]. Further analysis of the trading situation of each ETS pilot shows that there are obvious differences in the operational status of different carbon trading markets. According to Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, the Guangdong, Hubei and Shenzhen pilots are at the top of the group both in terms of volume and turnover, pulling away from the lagging pilots, such as the Tianjin and Chongqing pilots, by a visible margin. The above results not only indicate the obvious differences in the activity and maturity of each pilot market, but also mean that Fig. 3. Carbon allowance cumulative trading volume in seven pilot carbon markets (2013/6/19- 2023/3/24). Fig. 4. Carbon allowance cumulative turnover in seven pilot carbon markets (2013/6/19- 2023/3/24). Wei J., Chen J. 1378 the studies focusing only on individual markets may not be able to grasp the overall trends and characteristics of China\u2019s ETS construction as a whole due to ignoring these gaps. In the current research on CAP of China, researchers have found the characteristics of kurtosis bias, fat tails, non-normal distribution, wave clustering and long memory in the sequence of CAP returns [22-24], as well as significant price volatility heterogeneity among different pilots [25-26]. In these pre-existing pilot markets, although CAP are generally stable and smoothly transmitted, there are clear price fragmentation between different markets, and fluctuations in a small number of CAP can control price transmission across the whole carbon market [27]. Compared with the carbon markets in the US and Europe, the problems of convergent trading decisions and limited inter-firm liquidity are more pronounced in the pilot carbon markets except Hubei, which is one of the reasons why the CAP volatility in the carbon market departs from the normal level [28]. In terms of external influences factors, the news, government policies, the development of clean energy, stock market, electricity prices and the COVID-19 outbreak have been shown to have a significant impact on CAP trend [29-31] and it is clear that the role of these influencing factors is heterogeneous in different carbon markets [32- 34]. Looking further at individual carbon markets, the researches on the Shenzhen and Hubei carbon markets is more abundant. For Shenzhen, it can be found that the price of carbon credits is more stable and lower, compared to EU-ETS [35]. The volatility of the yield gradually decreases and is negatively correlated with the expected risk [36]. After 2018, however, because of the recession and lack of market information, price volatility began to rise with an asymmetric trend and market trading risks are accumulating [37]. At the same time, there is an interactive correlation between the energy market and the Shenzhen\u2019s carbon market with a multifractal character [38]. As for the Hubei carbon market, studies have revealed the existence of three periods of sharp fluctuations in Hubei\u2019s CAP under the influence of government carbon emission policies and clean energy development policies as well as the outbreak of COVID-19 [39]. Meanwhile, the volatility of CAP returns in Hubei has a significant leverage effect, and negative news has a stronger impact on the market than positive news [40]. Through combing and analyzing the previous literature research results on CAP, it is found that previous studies have focused on mature carbon trading markets in the world, such as the European carbon trading system, or just on a particular carbon trading market in China. Only very few papers have studied multiple markets simultaneously or have used holistic data. From the current studies, there is still a lack of overall understanding of the volatility characteristics or the operation of CAP in China. In particular, there has been no progress in the study of the non-linear structure of CAP fluctuations and the mechanism of regime transition, which is crucial to the study of carbon market risk",

In particular, there has been no progress in the study of the non-linear structure of CAP fluctuations and the mechanism of regime transition, which is crucial to the study of carbon market risk. The marginal contribution of this paper is to introduce non-linear models into the study of CAP in China's carbon market. The paper identifies the volatility characteristics of CAP by constructing a non-linear model, and conduct a deep excavation of the operation state and mechanism transformation of CAP by using a regime switching model. From a more realistic perspective, China's carbon market, after several years of construction and development, has now become one of the largest carbon markets on the planet, completing the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle in the world's carbon market. As we can see, China's success in carbon market construction not only marks another solid step in China's response to climate change, but also provides a huge boost to global climate governance and carbon emission reduction, and provides Chinese experience and solutions for other countries to achieve their own low-carbon development goals and build a reasonable and efficient carbon market system, which is also the practical significance of the study of China's carbon market for the world. Materials and Methods Empirical Model Threshold Auto-regressive Model (TAR model) As a type of nonlinear models, TAR model can explain the nonlinear characteristics in financial data, which was first proposed by Tong in 1980 [41]. TAR model sets a particular point in time where the motion of the time series jumps from one regime to another, while this jump is discrete. TAR model has better properties in fitting the actual data, compared with the linear regression model, due to its advantages in effectively identifying the nonlinear dynamic adjustment characteristics and regime transition of the time series [42]. The three-regime multi-order TAR model has the following form: (1) In formula (1), \u03c6 are autoregressive coefficients \u03c3 are standard deviations of noise r are threshold values \u03c1 are lag orders of autoregressive variables and d is the lag order of the transformation variable. Markov Regime Switching Model (MRS model) Similar to TAR model, MRS model also has several different regimes, which relies on certain conditions to switch between regimes. Compared to MRS model, Research on Carbon Allowance Price Non-Linear... 1379 It\u20131 denotes all the information available up to moment t-1; the vector of parameters to be estimated for the model is \u0398, \u0398 = {\u03bc(1), \u03bc(2), ..., \u03bc(k); \u03c3}. When the probability f(St = i|It\u20131) is known, then under the condition that It\u20131 is known, the probability density of yt takes the following form: (7) The total log-likelihood function is expressed in the following form: (8) The filtering probability of St is as follows: (9) The smoothing probability1 is calculated as follows: (10) There are three methods to estimate the parameters of MRA model: Hamilton\u2019s maximum likelihood estimation [44], Hamilton\u2019s EM algorithm [45], and Albert and Chib\u2019s Gibbs sampling algorithm [46]. In general, the EM algorithm is difficult to implement when there is an AR term present in the model, while the Gibbs sampling algorithm requires a large number of operations. Therefore, the paper chooses the maximum likelihood algorithm to estimate the parameters of the model. Data Source and Processing In terms of data source, we consider that carbon trading activities are mainly carried out in pilot regions, and different carbon trading markets have different CAP. In order to reflect the overall performance of CAP in China\u2019s carbon market, the paper selects the China\u2019s Carbon Market Value Index (CCMVI), which is developed by Beijing Green Finance Association (BGFA) and published by China Beijing Green Exchange (CBGE), as a comprehensive indicator to reflect the dynamic changes of CAP in China\u2019s carbon 1 A smoothing probability is actually a conditional probabil- ity that reflects the probability of being in a particular state at each period obtained conditional on all observable infor- mation sets. By looking at the smoothing probability graph, it is clear how persistent each state is, and which state is most likely to be present at each moment. The basic judgment is that if the smoothed probability of a state is greater than 0.5, then this state is most likely to appear in that period. The smoothing probability better captures the trajectory of price transitions between states. the transitions between the regimes of TAR model can be observed more easily and directly. By identifying the transition mechanisms through a simple division of thresholds, TAR model allows for a more intuitive form and structure of the model fit, but this also lacks the ability to capture the details of the dynamics of the transitions within the system. However, in MRS model, the actual state of each regime and the transition details can be observed through probabilistic inference, so it is able to capture the dynamic process of more subtle and complex mechanism transitions [43], which compensates for the inadequate mechanism identification of TAR model. MRS model assumes that the state of fluctuations can be described by the state at moment t0, thus determining the regime state process of the system at moment t>t0. To obtain the relevant process, we then have to consider the price transformation state at moment t0 as a known price transformation state, i.e., assume that: (2) In Equation (2), {Xt, t\u2208T} is the stochastic process. Next, we introduce a random variable St into the system that represents the different regime states that the price is in. Assuming that the price state variable St can only take a positive integer value and the probability that St equals a certain value is only affected by the value of St\u20131 in the previous period, the distribution function of its price change becomes the following form: (3) Assuming that yt is the variable representing the price of carbon, the MRS model representing price fluctuations is as follows: (4) In Equation (4), \u03bcSt represents the mean of the series in the state at moment t; \u03c6St represents the autoregressive coefficient at moment t; \u03b5t~N(0, \u03c32); St = 1, 2, ..., k, whose transfer probability can be described by the following transfer probability matrix P: (5) In Equation (5), 0\u2264pij\u22641, \u2211m j=1 pij; i = 1, 2, ..., n; j = 1, 2, ..., m. The probability density of Xt in state St = i can be written in the following form: (6) Wei J., Chen J. 1380 market. CCMVI is compiled by taking the average price of carbon emission allowances traded online in six carbon trading pilot regions, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangdong, Hubei and Shenzhen, which are already traded in the market, as a sample to measure the changes of the overall CAP in the sample regions within a certain period2. For data selection, the paper selects the weekly average index values of CCMVI from January 1, 2018 to January 22, 2023 (shown in Fig. 5) and take their log returns (shown in Fig. 6) as the data material for the model construction below. The reasons for doing so are as follows: first, as seen in Fig. 2, the prices of each pilot carbon trading market have entered a stable phase 2 The above contents are from the official website of CBGE (https://www.cbgex.com.cn/) in 2018 with narrower volatility, indicating that China\u2019s ETS is gradually maturing in terms of trading patterns and market norms after the initial market shocks at its establishment [47]. Second, China announced a moratorium on the acceptance of national certified voluntary emission reductions (CCERs) in 2017, leading to carbon allowances becoming the main source for companies to obtain carbon emission rights. In order to exclude that this external event leads to heterogeneous changes in the intrinsic structure of CAP movements, which has an impact on the study of CAP volatility mechanisms and makes the before and after results incomparable, this paper therefore selects data from 2017 onwards. The descriptive statistics and ADF tests of the data are shown in Table 1. Fig. 5. Weekly average trend of CCMVI. Fig. 6. The log return rate of CCMVI.

Research on Carbon Allowance Price Non-Linear... 1381 Results Decomposition of the Switching Interval of CAP Based on the TAR Model As shown in Table 1, the data satisfy the requirements of model fitting for stability. Table 2 shows the results of the Hansen test for the non-linear structure of the data and the number of intervals. In the test, the wald statistic contains redundant parameters that are not identified by the original hypothesis because the threshold is unknown in the usual case, resulting in the asymptotic distribution of the F statistic used to test the model fitness is not the standard \u03c72 distribution. Hansen (1996) derived the asymptotic distribution of this statistic and found that the critical value of this test statistic varies with the data process. Therefore, the paper borrows the method proposed by Hansen and uses Bootstrap to randomly sample 500 times to obtain the critical values of the approximate statistic, as shown in the fourth line of Table 2. Based on the results in Table 2, it can be seen that the values of the test statistics of TAR (2) and TAR (3) are both greater than the 95% critical value, rejecting the linearity hypothesis and indicating the existence of a nonlinear structure of the data, which confirms the conclusion of our analysis above. Also, since the SSR of TAR (3) was smaller than that of TAR (2), the TAR model with a two-threshold three-mechanism is finally selected. According to the results in Table 3, the paper selects the maximum lag order of autoregressive variables as 3 and takes 1 as the lag order of the transformation variable, and according to the principle of minimum AIC, the TAR model is finally obtained as shown in Table 4. The fluctuation state of CAP is divided into three mechanisms of high, medium and low according to the threshold value, as shown in Fig. 7. Based on the above empirical results, the following conclusions can be drawn: First, according to the proportion of intervals, CAP fluctuate mainly in the low and medium regimes most of the time, and the periods with a fluctuation of more than 3.9% accounted for only 15.81% of the total duration of the study, indicating that the risk of price bubbles in the carbon market is low in general and the market sentiment of overheated speculation has not yet appeared in the carbon market. Second, from the regression results of the TAR model, the coefficients of the lagged terms are negative in both the low and high regime models, which reflects the existence of a stabilization mechanism for CAP. When the price in the market is too low or appears to fall sharply, the coefficient with negative sign can significantly reverse the negative price fluctuation in the previous period into a positive price increase trend, thus Table 1.

However, when there is an excessive price increase, a coefficient less than zero can again suppress overheating momentum in the market and bring prices back to the medium and low regime. At the same time, in terms of the process by which the stabilization mechanism works, when prices are in the low regime, the lagged one-period term can have a direct and significant effect on them, while when prices are in the high regime, it is the variables in lag two and lag three that have a significant effect on prices, which indicates that the price adjustment takes longer and the buffer process is slower compared to the low state. We can refer to this phenomenon as \u201cstrong lift and soft landing\u201d. As for the source of this stabilization mechanism, considering that the carbon market is still a government-led policy market [48], the price stabilization mechanism similar to the traditional commodity market is not mature in the carbon market, so we consider that this stabilization mechanism is more likely to be the result of external government intervention, and that the equilibrium forces within the market due to the game between supply and demand may not be the main reason in the short term.

Research on Carbon Allowance Price Non-Linear... 1383 Analysis of the Switching Mechanism of CAP Based on the MRS Model Through the threshold value division of TAR model, it can be clearly seen that there is an obvious regime conversion in the process of CAP fluctuations. Although above content has explained some properties and characteristics of this transformation to a certain extent in the above analysis, we still lack a grasp of the details of this dynamic transformation inside the system. MRS model can help us to better capture the more subtle and complex changes that exist in the process of regime switching. According to the mathematical model in Section 2, the maximum likelihood estimation method is used to estimate MRS model\u2019s parameters under various regimes. The results of the obtained parameters are shown in Table 5. For the model fitting effect, first, the means (\u03bc1, \u03bc2 and \u03bc3) obtained using MRS model for states 1, 2, and 3 are significant at the 1% level, and the values of the three means are highly differentiated in terms of sign and magnitude. Second, by correlation tests for the residual series after model fitting, it can be seen that there is no autocorrelation in the residual series (as shown in Table 6), which indicates that the model fits relatively well and the relevant information in the data has been fully extracted. From the empirical results of parameter estimation in Table 5, the parameters of CAP fluctuation model meet the significance requirement on the corresponding statistical indicators, which empirically confirms the existence of a relatively obvious three-regime transition in the dynamic process of CAP changes. Such results also suggest that CAP exist a structural transformation of the interval in the course of the change, revalidating the above conclusions",

Second, by correlation tests for the residual series after model fitting, it can be seen that there is no autocorrelation in the residual series (as shown in Table 6), which indicates that the model fits relatively well and the relevant information in the data has been fully extracted. From the empirical results of parameter estimation in Table 5, the parameters of CAP fluctuation model meet the significance requirement on the corresponding statistical indicators, which empirically confirms the existence of a relatively obvious three-regime transition in the dynamic process of CAP changes. Such results also suggest that CAP exist a structural transformation of the interval in the course of the change, revalidating the above conclusions. From the empirical results in Table 5, it can be learned that there are three regimes in the operating process of CAP: (1) CAP rise significantly, with Table 5. Estimation results of MRS model.

The three-regime average variance of the MRS model is 0.8, indicating that there is a certain degree of volatility uncertainty in the operation of CAP, Fig. 10. The state of small increase of CAP (St = 3). Fig. 8. The state of large increases of CAP (St = 1). Fig. 9. The state of the sharp decline of CAP (St = 2). Research on Carbon Allowance Price Non-Linear... 1385 while the overall risk of abnormal fluctuations is not high. According to the transition probability matrix in Table 7, we can see that there are significant differences in the interconversion scenarios between the different states. Excluding the diagonal same-state probabilities, the maximum probability value in the matrix is P23 (60.83%), followed by P12 (49.95%) and then P13 (33.89%). High values of P23, P12 and P13 in the transition probability matrix indicate that cases of sharp declines followed by small increases, sharp increases followed by a fall in the rate of increase, and sharp increases followed by sharp declines are more likely to occur in CAP, and multiple trends of price changes are intertwined in the carbon market. In essence, whether the price of carbon falls sharply and then rises sharply or rises sharply and then falls sharply or rises sharply and then rises sharply, these price fluctuations are normal market reflections and are the result of price stabilization mechanisms. However, for traders in the market, in addition to the need to be clear about the mechanism of price changes, but also the need to be clear about the duration of such price changes, so that the risks associated with price fluctuations can have a clearer understanding. From the smoothed probability graphs of the three regimes, it can be seen that compared to St = 1 and St = 2, the smoothed probability curve at St = 3 has a wider peak, the longest continuation and spans the most periods, which indicates that small increases are the main form of CAP fluctuations in the China\u2019s carbon market. This can also be verified in Table 8. In Table 8, the probability of P33 is up to 94%, with an average duration of nearly 16 weeks, again indicating that small increases are the most common, stable and persistent form of CAP volatility. In addition, the results in Fig. 8 to Fig. 10 show that state 1 and state 2 occur at similar points in time, often in tandem, and this important feature also points us to some special moments in which the carbon market is experiencing intense price shocks. According to the time points in the graph, the time points when CAP fluctuate drastically are mainly in the two years of 2018 and 2019, which indicates that some external or internal unstable factors could still have a significant impact on the normal operation of CAP during this period, and this is also an important symptom of the immaturity of the carbon market at the early stage of establishment. With the continuous improvement of the carbon market system and the gradual clarification of the carbon emission control targets, industry inclusion standards and market supervision tools by the local pilot carbon market regulators, especially in December 2020, China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment promulgated the Measures for the Administration of Carbon Emissions Trading (for Trial Implementation), which clarifies the offset mechanism, participation thresholds, allocation methods of allowances, registration system and penalty rules of the carbon trade, effectively contributing to the stable development of the carbon market, and the frequency of the dramatic CAP fluctuations has been reduced obviously after 2019. Discussion The models constructed in the above sections have provided an in-depth analysis of the volatility characteristics of CAP, especially in MRS model, which describes in detail the state persistence and transition characteristics of CAP in the process of operation from the perspective of regime transformation probabilities. It is important to note that in MRS model, different gain or loss scenarios correspond to different price states, and each state and the relationship between states can be represented by the corresponding transformation and persistence probabilities, so that gains and losses are linked to the probability of state transformation and persistence. For investors, the expected return under certain conditions can be obtained by combining the gains or losses in different situations with the corresponding probabilities. According to the conclusions obtained above, different states have different durations and there is a certain transition interval between states. The carbon market takes roughly 6 to 10 weeks to complete one regime transformation, roughly 40 to 60 weeks to complete two regime transformations, and longer to complete three transformations, with an average of 2 to 3 years.

In Table 9, St0, St1, St2, and St3 denote the initial state, the state after one transformation, the state after two transformations, and the state after three transformations, respectively. From the results in Table 9, it can be seen that the negative expected return of investors when no state conversion occurs indicates that in the current China\u2019s carbon market, the speculative behavior of achieving the purpose of short-term cash out for profit through rapid inflow and rapid outflow of capital is highly likely to bring losses to investors and should be used with caution by investors. However, what is of more concern is that the expected returns in the carbon market are gradually increasing as the duration increases. Such results suggest that investors may be wiser to invest in the carbon market for the long term, and China\u2019s carbon market appears to be more welcoming to \u201cpatient\u201d investors. But, the current worrisome situation is that the accumulation of uncertainties in the world economy, the increasing volatility of the macroeconomic environment, the sluggish growth and increased downward pressure on the economy of many countries, and the COVID-19 outbreak since 2020 have led investors to lower their confidence and expectations for the future, and thus the pool of \u201cpatient\u201d investors has shrunk significantly [49], and the investors willing to take a long-term position in the carbon market may not be easy to find for a while. Nevertheless, considering that China\u2019s ETS is a new type of market that is gradually being expanded from regional pilots to nationwide, its functions and roles are improving, and the Chinese government is showing great determination to achieve the \u201cdouble carbon\u201d goal, China\u2019s ETS can therefore provide an ideal option for investors with confidence in the carbon market to invest for the long term. In addition to the rate of return, investors also need to be alert to the risks associated with abnormal price fluctuations of traded goods in the carbon market. In financial markets, Value at Risk (VaR) is widely used to reveal the degree of risk of gain or loss from price fluctuations in investments, and this methodology can be applied to the carbon market as well. The standard deviation of the VaR values can be indicative of the market volatility of the exchanges, and the larger the standard deviation of VaR indicates the greater the volatility risk of the market [50]. Based on the calculations, we find that although the overall volatility risk of China\u2019s carbon market is low, with a VaR standard deviation of only 2.8976, the calculation result of local pilot markets reminds us that there may be large risk deviation in individual markets due to the huge differences in different pilot markets. We measured the three pilot markets with the most active trading activities, Shenzhen, Guangdong and Hubei, and the results show that the VaR standard deviation of Guangdong carbon market is the smallest (0.6044), followed by Hubei (1.6781) and finally Shenzhen (24.6661), with clear differences in volatility risk among them. The above results reflect that, in addition to considering returns, it may be more prudent for investors to choose carbon markets such as Hubei or Guangdong if they are risk-averse in their analysis of CAP volatility. Our findings are consistent with those obtained from the empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based multifractal depolymerization fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) [51] and are reliable. Conclusions and Policy Implications Based on the weekly average closing price of China\u2019s carbon market value index from January 1, 2018 to January 22, 2023, this paper uses TAR model and MRS model to study the nonlinear fluctuation characteristics and regime transformation mechanism of China\u2019s CAP, captures and describes the nonlinear threshold structure of China\u2019s CAP fluctuation and the complex dynamic change process of multi-stage operation, and measures and analyzes the probability of the transformation between different regimes. Through identifying the nonlinear fluctuation structure and regime transition of the dynamic process of CAP operation during the study period, the final conclusions are as follows: First, CAP during the study period show significant non-linear fluctuation characteristics. Using the threshold value to divide the range of price operation, three operating stages of high, medium and low are clearly shown in the results. CAP fluctuate mainly in the medium and low stages for most of the time, with fluctuations of more than 3.9% of the total time period studied accounting for only 15.8% of the total time period studied, indicating that overall risk of a price bubble in the China\u2019s carbon market is low and that overheated market speculation has not yet occurred in the carbon market.

By estimating the regression coefficients in the model, it can be seen that when prices become imbalanced and enter the high or low mechanism, the stabilization mechanism can adequately regulate the trend of CAP fluctuation, so that it can eventually converge back to the normal state, instead of deviating more and more from the stable state after the imbalance. In terms of the process and time of adjustment, the adjustment is significantly faster when the price falls than when the price is too high, i.e., the so-called \u201cstrong lift and soft landing\u201d phenomenon. Thirdly, CAP fluctuations during the study period show a clear three-regime transformation process, including a moderate increase, a sharp increase and a sharp decrease. In China\u2019s carbon market, the small increase is the most common, stable and persistent form of CAP volatility. Meanwhile, the three price transition situations of a sharp decline followed by a small increase, a sharp increase followed by a decrease in the rate of increase, and a sharp increase followed by a sharp decrease are the most likely to occur in CAP, showing the complexity of price operation in the carbon market. In addition, as a new type of market, on the one hand, ETS can also provide a good platform for investors to make long-term investments with the strong support and continuous construction of the Chinese government; but on the other hand, investors should not take lightly the risk of other possible states and abnormal CAP fluctuations. even though small increases are the main trend in CAP changes. All of the above are studies and summaries of the past performance of CAP. By studying the performance of CAP, the above findings fully affirm the carbon market construction efforts over the past years. However, considering that China\u2019s ETS is not yet truly mature, the future trend of CAP still needs to be closely watched, and the risk of large fluctuations in a short period of time that could affect the development of the carbon market cannot be ruled out. In order to achieve the long-term development of the carbon market, based on the ETS\u2019s actual situation in China, we make the suggestions as follows: First, building a nationwide carbon derivatives market. According to the experience of EU-ETS, in the face of irregular price fluctuations and abnormal risk shocks in the carbon market, carbon derivatives such as forwards, futures, options, etc. can not only provide good risk management tools for participants in carbon trading, but also provide pathways for liquidity enhancement and value discovery in carbon markets. Second, improving the information disclosure system. The additional risks caused by abnormal price fluctuations are to a large extent due to opaque information disclosure and poor market liquidity. Although price fluctuations in China\u2019s carbon market are currently more moderate, the possibility of drastic changes and the risks associated with abnormal fluctuations still exist, which actually increase the expenses of participating in carbon trading for both enterprises and investors, thus affecting the incentives of trading parties to participate in carbon allowance trading. Increasing market liquidity will help price signals to be transmitted quickly and effectively in the market. Adequate liquidity is the key to forming reasonable and real prices, which is the key to guiding participating entities to actively engage in carbon trading, offsets, or credits. Third, improving relevant laws and regulations and system construction",

Adequate liquidity is the key to forming reasonable and real prices, which is the key to guiding participating entities to actively engage in carbon trading, offsets, or credits. Third, improving relevant laws and regulations and system construction. Improving system construction is an effective measure to prevent the risk of overall CAP fluctuations and can provide a better environment for the development of the carbon market. At present, there are not enough laws and regulations for the secondary market of carbon trading, and the regulation and supervision system of carbon emission rights trading is missing. The competent departments, registries and exchanges should speed up the improvement of trading supervision details, establish a national unified management regulation of carbon emission rights trading, and provide standardized processes for participating entities to effectively prevent operational risks and ensure the normal operation of ETS. Finally, improving the long-term stabilization mechanism of ETS. The long-term stabilization mechanism of ETS is an effective tool to prevent drastic price fluctuations and market failures in the carbon market, which has played a better role in stabilizing CAP and preventing volatility risks, such as the Market Stability Reserve Mechanism (MSR) proposed by the EU in 2015 [52]. At present, from the first compliance situation in China, the compliance rate has reached 99.5% [53], and carbon allowances are relatively sufficient. In order to ensure CAP stability, it is necessary to \u201creserve\u201d excess carbon allowances, reduce the amount of carbon allowances circulating in the market, and stabilize the price of carbon by \u201creleasing\u201d previously stored allowances in the event of a strong increase in CAP and a shortage of allowances in the market. From the international experience, China can set up a long-term market stabilization mechanism to balance the market supply and demand, to prevent the risk of price fluctuation by relatively market-oriented means, and to solve the problem of short-term price fluctuation and long-term poor liquidity in the market. At the end of the article, we need to point out that the market itself is always in the process of change and development as China\u2019s carbon market is constantly being built and improved. The analysis of CAP in this paper is based on the past performance of CAP, which can effectively explain the past price fluctuations, but the prediction of future price fluctuations is not strong, and remains in a static analysis. Therefore, if external environmental variables can be incorporated into the analysis and prediction of CAP fluctuations, more realistic and apposite result may be obtained, especially for forecasting purposes.

Firstly, we assume that investor\u2019s risk preferences and beliefs are primarily observed in main world indices and then transmitted to other markets such as IInd pillar life-cycle pension funds. This enables both regime (market state) iden- ti\ufb01cation and regime-switching detection. Second, we apply stress to the transition matrix by increasing probabilities of moving to a worse market state, i.e., we increase the transi- tion probabilities on the upper-right side of the main diagonal and decrease the diagonal probabilities correspondingly. Third, future scenarios (evolution) of returns of pension funds are generated using stressed transition matrices and basic risk and performance measures of the \ufb01nal wealth are presented. Finally, three different strategies for pension managers are considered and compared to each other. The results show how the best strategy depends on the stress level.

As participation in IInd pillar pension funds was quasi- mandatory, more than 90% of those who receive insurable income have already become members of some funded pension scheme. By 2019, pension accumulation companies have been offering pension funds of different risk levels based on the share of investments in equi- ties that ranges from 0% (conservative) to 100% (risky) (Bank of Lithuania, 2017). However, B Audrius Kaba\u0161inskas audrius.kabasinskas@ktu.lt 1 Department of Mathematical Modeling, Kaunas University of Technology, Studentu 50-143, 51368 Kaunas, Lithuania 2 Department of Probability and Mathematical Statistics, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, Sokolovska 83, 121 16 Praha, Czech Republic 3 School of Economics and Business, Kaunas University of Technology, Donelaicio 20, Kaunas, Lithuania 123 Annals of Operations Research empirical evidence showed (Medaiskis et al., 2018b) that the majority of pension system participants made irrational decision when choosing the pension fund in terms of their risk pro\ufb01le and then changing it during the accumulation period. Moreover, among those who changed funds, some participants switched to an inappropriate fund according to the eco- nomic cycle observed in the \ufb01nancial market. These are examples of reasons why pension accumulation companies have been obliged to establish life-cycle pension funds which are most appropriate to them in terms of participant\u2019s age. This means that fund managers take full responsibility for asset allocation, diversi\ufb01cation, rebalancing, and securing the wealth accrued over a lifetime once the participant approaches retirement age. As such, life-cycle funds are also referred to as target date funds, and the assets of funds are invested in accor- dance with a prede\ufb01ned investment strategy changing over time based on participants\u2019s age, also known as a glide path. Frequent reforms in the past few decades in Lithuanian IInd pillar pension system have cre- ated concern and distrust amongst its participants. The COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukrainian war and high in\ufb02ation have raised concerns about the resilience of the IInd pillar pension funds to external shocks. In Lithuania, there is little information on pension fund stress tests, and for those that have been done, the reports are not public. These conditions limit the ability of the pension fund participant to comprehend the risks they are exposed to, which could lead to adverse conditions if an event such as a \ufb01nancial, economic, or political crisis occurs. Within this topic, the most relevant paper that focus on IInd pillar PFs in Lithuania was published by (Medaiskis et al., 2018a). In their paper, the authors perform sensitivity analysis of optimal life-cycle investment strategy of IInd pillar PFs. The benchmark case was modi\ufb01ed by changing the parameters of participant\u2019s contribution rates, preferences, labour income process and investment performance. Speci\ufb01cally, to assess the resilience of a country\u2019s \ufb01nancial system to shocks, stress testing is a widely used tool by supervisory authorities such as banks to quantify the impact of poten- tial risks on the \ufb01nancial sector as well as to test the overall stability of the \ufb01nancial system (Acharya et al., 2018; Sahin et al., 2020; Jobst et al., 2017; Garc\u00eda & Steele, 2022; European Court of Auditors, 2019). In the US, stress tests were applied to regulate banks to build up reserves that they could use to continue lending when the economy entered a deep recession (Kohn & Liang, 2019). Two testing techniques are usually used: bottom-up testing, which is designed to assess the resilience of a speci\ufb01c \ufb01nancial institution to economic shocks, and top- down testing, which is designed to compare the results obtained after performing bottom-up testing, thereby identifying inconsistencies in the testing performed by \ufb01nancial institutions (ECB, 2013; Bank of Lithuania, 2022). Bottom-up testing is performed by commercial banks using available data and their own models. The central bank or other supervisory authority can set certain limitations of modelling and, applying their analysis tools, check and eval- uate the results obtained by commercial banks. Meanwhile, top-down testing is performed without involving the central banks themselves, usually commercial banks, in the assess- ment process, as this procedure aims to assess the resistance of the entire banking system to adverse economic shocks (Butkus & Narusevicius, 2015). When performing bottom-up testing, \ufb01nancial institutions, using different methods, ask different questions and therefore involve different risks. Sahin et al. (2020) examined several macroeconomic scenarios, tak- ing into account the exposures of the banks and the business models. The authors con\ufb01rm that the disclosure of stress test information has had an impact on the movement of both the stock and credit market, thus demonstrating that stress tests have an impact on systemic risk and bank behaviour. Garc\u00eda and Steele (2022), Acharya et al. (2018) evaluate the effects of transparency disclosure on bank behaviour and demonstrate that when regulatory attention is focused on improving the quantity and quality of bank capital, it also improves \ufb01nancial 123 Annals of Operations Research stability, transparency, and market discipline. Mennis et al. (2018) demonstrated the effect of lower investment returns and high volatility on pension systems. To protect the pension fund against shocks, Moriggia et al. (2019) included hedging \ufb01nancial contracts in the form of put options in stress testing. Unlike other authors, Joshi and Pitt (2010) used stress tests to assess the impact of actuarial calculations on pricing and capital level management in life and non-life insurance. Lithuanian Bank Supervision Department (2017) ensures that the stress testing carried out by insurance companies is properly organised, prepares stress testing guidelines, but there is still a lack of scienti\ufb01c research in conducting stress tests for insurance companies in Lithuania. Moriggia et al. (2019) noted that pension funds during recent years have been stressed, both equity and alternative investment markets have exceeded their usual levels of riskiness. Therefore, it is necessary to manage pension funds ef\ufb01ciently, satisfying such targets as liquidity, returns, exposure to individual assets, and funding gap. Scienti\ufb01c research further analysed shows that stress tests can be applied not only in the \ufb01nancial sector but also in assessing the resistance of various companies and markets. Zaple- tal et al. (2020) performed stress testing to determine the optimal production and emissions coverage for an industrial company. Compared to others, Hong et al. (2022) investigated the impact of \ufb01nancial stress on crude oil prices. Similarly, Scarcioffolo and Etienne (2021) used stress tests to identify oil and natural gas price volatility patterns in the US Sarafrazi et al. (2015) identi\ufb01ed the linkages between high volatility in the stock markets and \ufb01nancial mar- kets in the US Singh and Singh (2017) studied the linkages between \ufb01nancial stress indices of the US and Brazil, Russia, India, and China, demonstrating the dependence of economic policy initiatives. Several authors examined different evaluation methods for stress testing. For instance, Moriggia et al. (2019) developed a new stress testing technique suitable for multistage scenario trees, namely nodal contamination, and proposed an asset-liability model (ALM) structured as a multistage stochastic programming problem. Stochastic programming for stress tests was also used by Zapletal et al",

Scienti\ufb01c research further analysed shows that stress tests can be applied not only in the \ufb01nancial sector but also in assessing the resistance of various companies and markets. Zaple- tal et al. (2020) performed stress testing to determine the optimal production and emissions coverage for an industrial company. Compared to others, Hong et al. (2022) investigated the impact of \ufb01nancial stress on crude oil prices. Similarly, Scarcioffolo and Etienne (2021) used stress tests to identify oil and natural gas price volatility patterns in the US Sarafrazi et al. (2015) identi\ufb01ed the linkages between high volatility in the stock markets and \ufb01nancial mar- kets in the US Singh and Singh (2017) studied the linkages between \ufb01nancial stress indices of the US and Brazil, Russia, India, and China, demonstrating the dependence of economic policy initiatives. Several authors examined different evaluation methods for stress testing. For instance, Moriggia et al. (2019) developed a new stress testing technique suitable for multistage scenario trees, namely nodal contamination, and proposed an asset-liability model (ALM) structured as a multistage stochastic programming problem. Stochastic programming for stress tests was also used by Zapletal et al. (2020) and Kopa et al. (2018). In particular, Kopa and Rus\u00fd (2023) emphasise the importance of stochastic dominance and claim the growing importance and interest of stochastic programming as a rapidly developing area of mathematical optimisation, as also demonstrated by Mennis et al. (2018). Comparatively, some researchers, e.g., Scarcioffolo and Etienne (2021), Sarafrazi et al. (2015), Hong et al. (2022), Alexander and Kaeck (2008), Dionne et al. (2011) tested Markov-Switching GARCH models, Dionne and Saissi Hassani (2017) used Markov regime-switching to consider busi- ness cycles when calculating a reserve capital. Ben Soltane and Naoui (2021) using a Markov switching methodology tested the responses of the time-varying stock returns to low market liquidity (both expected and unexpected). Liu et al. (2021) studied the volatility in regime- switching models, which were based on the geometric Brownian motion with Markov chains used to randomise its drift and volatility factors. As liquidity is prone to suddenly dry up, Acharya et al. (2013), Bouveret et al. (2015) and Flood et al. (2015) applied Markov models in the US corporate bond market to characterise a regime-switching behaviour of market liquidity. Han and Leika (2019) used Markov regime-switching models to demonstrate that aggregate market liquidity tends to switch from a high-liquidity regime to a low-liquidity regime. Bouveret et al. (2015) con\ufb01rmed \ufb01ndings that structural and cyclical factors, such as regulation and market volatility, potentially have an impact on the probability of being in a low-liquidity regime. Han and Leika (2019) argued that the framework can be extended further to estimate price impact measures, asset sale haircuts for asset and pension fund managers. In this paper, we introduce a methodology for stress testing (at various levels) of returns of pension funds using Hidden Markov Model for regime detection. Moreover, we identify the best strategies of pension fund managers for various stress levels. First, the regimes are 123 Annals of Operations Research detected from the performance of underlying stock and bond indices. Having the regimes and the estimated transition matrix, we stress this matrix and generate scenarios of future evolution of returns from the stressed model. Then we suggest possible strategies for pension managers to react on the regime switch and compare the performance of the strategies among each other for all considered stress levels. This methodology is applied to Lithuanian IInd pillar life-cycle pension funds managed by Swedbank. The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section2 presents the methodology, which covers the Hidden Markov Model for regime detection, a technique used for scenario genera- tion,andtheproposedstresstestingusingaMarkovregimeswitchingmodel,andadescription of the strategies to be employed. The computational results are provided in Sect. 3, which presents an overview of the pension funds considered and demonstrates the results of the stress tests for the different strategies taken. Concluding remarks, managerial insights, and future research directions are summarised in the last section. 2 Methodology In this section, we provide the concept of a stress testing applied to the IInd pillar pension funds. First we recall the basics of Hiden Markov Model (HMM) for regime detection and introduce the notation. We consider four regimes to distinguish among a non-crisis periods andthreekindsofcrisisperiods(shockonbondmarket,stockmarketorbothmarkets)Second, the notion of stressing the HMM is presented. It is based on a stress level k which determines the changes in transition matrix. The higher the stress level is, the more probable switch from the non-crisis to a crisis regime is considered. Third, scenario generation technique is shortly described. Finally, the considered strategies are introduced and their evaluation is discussed. The goal is to analyse the sensitivity of the strategies and their results to the choice of the stress level. 2.1 Hidden Markov model for regime switching Suppose that the dynamics of the returns of pension funds is governed by the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Hamilton, 1989; Lindgren, 1978). Speci\ufb01cally, the use of HMM to detect regimes enables incorporation of non-linear dynamics by determining a set of model parameters to be attributed to a particular time depending on the state. In particular, a regime-switching property provides a good \ufb01t to empirical data when considering a long-term perspective in the study. In general, the regime itself is unobserved, which means that one should make the inference about the number of regimes, their change point, and probabilities observed in the past (Piger, 2009). Conceptually, HMM is a probabilistic model in which a sequence of observations X = (x1, . . . , xt, . . . , xT ), xt \u2208Rd is generated by a \ufb01nite-state Markov chain with hidden states S = (s1, . . . , st, . . . , sT ), st \u2208{1, . . . , N} where N is the number of states which is \ufb01xed in time. The HMM is then speci\ufb01ed by the initial probability vector \u03c0i = Pr(s1 = i), i = {1, . . . N}, a transition probability matrix Pt = (pi j)t = Pr(st+1 = j|st = i), and the emission probabilities B, which can be any distribution conditioned on the current hidden state. More speci\ufb01cally, we consider a dependent mixture model, where the observations are distributed as a mixture with N states and the time dependencies between the observations are due to the time dependencies between the mixture states that follow a \ufb01rst-order Markov process. In this case, the joint likelihood of observations X and hidden states S with model 123 Annals of Operations Research parameters \u03b8 can be de\ufb01ned as f (X, S|\u03b8) = \u03c0 \u00b7 bs1(x1) T \u22121 \u0002 t=1 Pt \u00b7 bst (xt+1), where bst is a vector of observation densities b j st (xt) = Pr(xt|st = j) that provide the conditional densities of observations xt associated with the hidden state j, j = 1, . . . , N at time t = 1 . . . T . The parameters \u03c0, P and B must be estimated from the observed sequence X. To determine the time periods of different market states observed historically, we used a multiple change point detection model proposed by Lavielle and Lebarbier (2001). For this purpose, their approach employs a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithm to estimate the posterior distribution of the change-point process. The numerical experiments have shown that the procedure proposed in their paper is much faster than the Reversible Jump algorithm. Moreover, this technique, as a result, provides the additional probability p j that at a particular time t the corresponding regime st = j, j \u2208{1, . . . , N} is detected and a number N of regimes is expected. In the paper we assume that the key drivers which have an impact on PF performance arise from a global market, which is represented by two well-known indices, namely the MSCI World index (MSCI) and the Bloomberg Barclays Euro 1\u20135 year Bond index (BB EURO). Two indices are chosen because they are used by most pension fund managers as benchmarks. Moreover, they represent a typical investment strategy of pension funds: world stock funds and bond funds. Finally, usual regulations for pension fund strategies are expressed in terms of limits on stock or bond assets. The separate behaviour of stock and bond markets later is combined into four regimes of \ufb01nancial markets",

Two indices are chosen because they are used by most pension fund managers as benchmarks. Moreover, they represent a typical investment strategy of pension funds: world stock funds and bond funds. Finally, usual regulations for pension fund strategies are expressed in terms of limits on stock or bond assets. The separate behaviour of stock and bond markets later is combined into four regimes of \ufb01nancial markets. More speci\ufb01cally, the market regimes are de\ufb01ned by 4 states, such as Regime 1 is identi\ufb01ed if no shock is observed in both indices; Regime 2 is said to be detected if a non-typical behaviour is observed in the stock market index; Regime 3 is said to be detected if a non-typical behaviour is observed in the European bond market index; Regime 4 is identi\ufb01ed if both the stock market index and the bond market index are in shock status. Combining hidden states from stock and bond markets into four regimes is performed as follows: 1. detect one of two hidden states (no-crisis, crisis) of stock SS and bond funds SB markets separately (MSCI and BB EURO correspondingly) using algorithm by Lavielle and Lebarbier (2001); 2. extract probabilities of hidden states detected (Viterbi algorithm implementation in R, see Visser & Speekenbrink, 2010) 3. combine SS and SB into four regimes of the \ufb01nancial markets. The procedure for every observation moment t (t = 1, . . . , T ) is following: \u2013 if probabilities P(SS t = \u2019no-crisis\u2019) > 1/2 and P(SB t = \u2019no-crisis\u2019) > 1/2 (no- crisis in stock and bond markets simultaneously) then regime 1 (no-crisis) is identi\ufb01ed at time t; \u2013 if probabilities P(SS t = \u2019crisis\u2019) > 1/2 and P(SB t = \u2019no-crisis\u2019) > 1/2 then at time t regime 2 (stock crisis) is identi\ufb01ed; 123 Annals of Operations Research \u2013 if probabilities P(SS t = \u2019no-crisis\u2019) > 1/2 and P(SB t = \u2019crisis\u2019) > 1/2 then at time t regime 3 (bond crisis) is identi\ufb01ed; \u2013 if probabilities P(SS t = \u2019crisis\u2019) > 1/2 and P(SB t = \u2019crisis\u2019) > 1/2 then at time t regime 4 (global \ufb01nancial crisis) is identi\ufb01ed; 4. check if regimes identi\ufb01ed are coherent with real historical situation in the \ufb01nancial markets. In step 3 the probability 1/2 can be increased if more sure evidences of being in hidden state are needed. Probablity greater than 1/2 means \u201cit is more probable to be in particular state than in another\u201d. Then, transitions between regimes are given by a transition matrix P = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239d p11 p12 p13 p14 p21 p22 p23 p24 p31 p32 p33 p34 p41 p42 p43 p44 \u239e \u239f\u239f\u23a0. (1) As hidden states st are speci\ufb01ed by a time-independent transition matrix P, then a vector \u03c0 of steady-state probabilities is determined from a \u03c0 = \u03c0 P subject to 4 j=1 pi j = 1. These probabilities describe the possibility of \ufb01nally appearing in a particular state. How- ever, this can only be done if the Markov chain is stationary or it follows the so-called Markovianity property (see Bickenbach & Bode, 2001). If the stationary distribution \u03c0 exists, then this means that the \u201clong-term\u201d probability of being in state s is given by \u03c0i. These prob- abilities can be interpreted as the proportion of time on average that the system spends in other states (see Billingsley, 1995). Let Tj = min{n : Xn = j} denote the time to the \ufb01rst switch to state j. This is a random variable, with special case Tj = \u221eif the visit never occurs. Then the mean \ufb01rst-passage time (MFPT) de\ufb01nes the average time for a stochastic event to \ufb01rst occur (see Sheskin, 1995; Polizzi et al., 2016). Once we have transition probabilities, we can generate sequences of future scenarios. Mixing them with separately generated returns in the corresponding state would imitate the potential performance of a pension fund or benchmark index. 2.2 Stress testing for Markov regime-switching model The considered regimes are based on the behaviour observed on the stock market and the bond market. Although the \ufb01rst regime is the most favourable for the participants, the other three describe the evolution of the indexes during some crises or non-typical circumstances. The worst regime is the last one. Therefore, the stress test is performed by increasing the transition probabilities from a better regime to a worse regime (state). In particular, for stress level k we increase probabilities p12, p13, p14, p24, p34 k-times. Moreover, the other nondiagonal probabilities are not changed because they correspond to switch to the better or indifferent state. Finally, the diagonal probabilities are decreased so that the sum of probabilities in each row equals 1. Assuming the same stress level k, all the probabilities of switching from better to worse regime are changed proportionally. For example, if the probability of transition from no crisis regime to the bond crises regime is the same as to the stock crisis regime in the original case, then it remains true in the stressed case as well. Summarising, if the original probability transition matrix is {pi j}4 i, j=1 then the stressed modi\ufb01cation at level k is de\ufb01ned 123 Annals of Operations Research as follows: p\u00d7k,12 = p12k p\u00d7k,13 = p13k p\u00d7k,14 = p14k p\u00d7k,24 = p24k p\u00d7k,34 = p34k p\u00d7k,23 = p23 p\u00d7k,i j = pi j, i > j, i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4 p\u00d7k,ii = 1 \u2212 j\u0338=i pi j, i = 1, 2, 3, 4 provided that all p\u00d7k,i j, i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4 are between 0 and 1, that is, stress levels giving k \u00b7 pi j > 1 for some i, j are not feasible. Since it might be dif\ufb01cult to set the stress level in real-world applications, we suggest to consider several stress levels and analyse the sensitivity of the results with respect to increasing stress levels as we demonstrate in Sects. 3.3 and 3.4. In the case when only one stress level has to be chosen for the particular break (for example, start of a pandemic) we can estimate transition matrix for the period before the break and after the break separately. Comparing the two transition matrices we can estimate the stress level k. In general, one can consider a stress matrix K = {k}4 i j=1 instead of stress level k and the stressed transition probabilities could be de\ufb01ned as follows: p\u00d7k,i j = pi jki j for i \u0338= j. However, it might be dif\ufb01cult to set all ki j in a reasonable way. Therefore we consider only the special choice described above which is easy to interpret. Having the stressed probability transition matrix, we generate future scenarios in the same way as for the original one. 2.3 Strategy analysis under different stress levels We generate 5000 replications of Markovian processes (1100 working days length) with different transition probabilities. The transition probabilities (see a transition matrix (1)) are chosen as a base for the simulation. First, we simulate trajectories with historical transition probabilities and such a process can serve as a benchmark, as at time T we have nearly asymptotic behaviour of the random variable as if it evolved as previously",

First, we simulate trajectories with historical transition probabilities and such a process can serve as a benchmark, as at time T we have nearly asymptotic behaviour of the random variable as if it evolved as previously. Second, we apply a stress to the transition matrix by worsening the chances of moving to a better market state, that is, we increase the transition probabilities on the upper-right side of the main diagonal and decrease the probabilities on the main diagonal correspondingly (see Sect. 2.2 for more details). We decided to increase the probabilities of worsening by rate k = 2, 3, 4, 10, 20 and 50. The rate of 2 means a light stress in the market as the probabilities of worsening (e.g., moving to any type of crisis state from the non-crisis state) are doubled (2\u00d7 pi j, \u2200i > j) and the probability of remaining in the state i is decreased by i> j pi j. Depending on the rate of worsening, we get different levels of stress. The higher the rate, the greater the probabilities of a crisis that we should expect in the future. In this way, we get new transition probabilities. Third, we simulate trajectories of regime process (in a way described in the beginning of this section) with stressed transition probabilities. 123 Annals of Operations Research Next, having a process of regimes, we can simulate stressed future behaviour of returns of each fund. In this research, we use the historical simulation technique. Therefore, the standard historical simulation is modi\ufb01ed in the following way: 1. Depending on regime (i = 1, . . . , 4) expected, we resample historical returns from the corresponding regime only; 2. We analyse three strategies (A, B, and C) of resampling: (a) Strategy A: the fund manager keeps allocations of fund unchanged (a passive reaction to crisis in the markets); (b) Strategy B: during stock market crisis (regimes 2 and 4) the fund manager changes the allocations of the fund to the allocations of the a little bit more conservative accumulation fund he manages (a weak reaction). (c) Strategy C: during the stock market crisis (regimes 2 and 4) the fund manager changes the allocations of the fund to the allocations of the most conservative accumulation fund he manages (a panic reaction). Finally, we take simulated values v(\u03c4, k, \u03a8 ) of the process at time T from all trajectories \u03c4 = 1, . . . , 5000 for allstress levels k = 2, 3, 4, 10, 20, 50 and for allstrategies\u03a8 = A, B, C and get the potential distribution of random variable (fund return) at time T for each stress level and strategy. The distribution obtained can be used for scenario generation and for strategy comparison. By performing an experiment using such a scheme, we can answer the important question: for which stress level is it wise to change investment strategy of pension funds during shocks and crisis in the stock markets. From an optimisation point of view, we need to solve the following discrete choice mul- tiobjective problem for each k = 2, 3, 4, 10, 20, 50: min \u03a8 \"F1(v(\u03c4, k, \u03a8 )), . . . , Fm(v(\u03c4, k, \u03a8 ))\" where F1(\u00b7), . . . , Fm(\u00b7) are the criteria considered, for example, mean loss, st. deviation, a risk measure, a deviation measure, etc. 3 Numerical results This section begins with a brief overview of daily log-returns of the Lithuanian pension funds. Later, hidden Markov chain technique was used to detect crisis/no-crisis regimes in global \ufb01nancial markets (2007\u20132022). Third, future scenarios of pension funds are generated using stressed transition matrices and historical daily log-returns. Finally, different response (to the crisis) strategies are compared, and the trade-off is discussed. 3.1 Quick overview of pension fund results Since 2019, there exist 40s pillar pension funds in Lithuania: 35 life-cycle funds that allocate asset based on participant\u2019s age and 5 asset preservation funds (herein noted by index T) that are designed for participants who have reached a retirement age and/or have chosen to receive periodic payments from the fund. In particular, life-cycle pension funds are arranged into the following birth-year groups: 1954\u20131960, 1961\u20131967, 1968\u20131974, 1975\u20131981, 1982\u20131988, 1989\u20131995 and 1996\u20132002 (herein, the two last digits will be used to denote the age group). All these funds are managed by \ufb01ve pension accumulation companies, speci\ufb01cally \u2019Allianz 123 Annals of Operations Research Fig. 1 Distribution of returns of IInd pillar PFs. Manager is given in the legend, while the participant\u2019s birth-year is attributed to the title of image panel. The special case \u201cT\u201d stands for the asset preservation PFs Lietuva gyvyb\u02d9es draudimas\u2019 (Allianz), \u2019INVL Asset Management\u2019 (INVL), \u2019Luminor inves- ticiju valdymas\u2019 (Luminor), \u2019SEB investiciju valdymas\u2019 (SEB), and \u2019Swedbank investiciju valdymas\u2019 (Swedbank). In the study, daily returns have been chosen as the main variable that represents the performance of the pension fund for the period between January 2019 and the end of August 2022 (see Fig. 1). Figure 1 draws our attention to the many extreme returns observed for all pension funds, with a heavier tail on a left side of the distribution. Obviously, this has been induced by COVID-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which started with a sudden shockwave around the world and shook \ufb01nancial markets around the world. Comparatively, the largest deviations observed for pension funds of young participants, namely from the 68\u201374 to 96\u2013 02 birth-year groups, could be explained by a higher allocation to equities in investment portfolio. However, some differences could be observed between managers. Speci\ufb01cally, LMNR funds demonstrated the lowest variation, except for the 54\u201360 birth-year group, while the highest uncertainty was observed for INVL and SWED funds. Surprisingly, conservative funds of birth-year groups 54\u201360 and asset-preserving funds (denoted with index T) also experienced a sharp drop, which is a result of extraordinarily volatility observed in the bond market. Table 1 summarises the pension fund market in terms of mean, standard deviation (StDev), minimum, maximum, skewness, kurtosis, value-at-risk (VaR), conditional value- at-risk (CVaR), maximum drawdown (MDD), average recovery time (ART), correlation between fund and MSCI (CorMSCI), and correlation between fund and BB EURO (CorBB). Additionally, the same empirical characteristics are given for indices as well. From Table 1, as expected, the funds for young participants exhibited a larger mean return comparatively, with the largest one observed for the Swedbank funds. The risk quanti\ufb01ed using StDev, VaR and CVaR had a tendency to increase in line with a growing portion of equities in the portfolio, with the largest estimates determined for Swedbank as well. As such, among PACs, balanced risk-return performance could be observed for Luminor funds. However, the funds of older participants suffered high losses determined by negative skew- ness and kurtosis, which holds for all PACs",

As can be seen in the table, MDD for young participants ranges from 28 to 32%, while for older participants\u2014from 10 to 22%. Correspondingly, the average time needed to recover from the drawdown, named ART, shows that it typically requires, on average, 9 days for the funds of young participants to revert to the long-run mean. Surprisingly, a different tendency is observed for older participants\u2019 funds, where comparatively a long ART is observed for Luminor funds, while other funds in this group have been able to handle it more rapidly. The last two columns of Table 1 imply that the strongest correlation with the MSCI index is observed for the Swedbank and Luminor funds, and the weakest correlation has been deter- mined for Allianz. For the index of BB EURO, the strongest relation is found, in general, for Luminor funds, where comparatively high correlation was determined for all asset-preserving funds. Visually, all possible correlations are shown in Fig. 13. Furthermore, the correlations between various performance measures of all pension funds analysed and market indices are provided in Fig. 14. 3.2 Detection of regimes in main world indices The sample period used in the analysis starts in January 2007 and ends in September 2022, covering the global \ufb01nancial crisis, the COVID-19 outbreak, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and other disturbances that caused abrupt price changes (see Fig. 2). As evidenced in Fig. 2, both MSCI and BB EURO historically exhibited a clustering of volatility: volatility changes over time and tends to persist, determining periods of low and high volatility. In particular, it can be seen that there exist subperiods, when high/low volatility is observed for each index separately, and subperiods with differing volatility between indices. As such, a global market de\ufb01ned through MSCI and EURO BB is de\ufb01ned by a 4-state Markov regime-switching model, which was introduced in Sect. 2.1. Speci\ufb01cally, Fig. 3 illustrates the regime detected over sampled period. Figure 3 shows that the switch to Regime 3 is much more often observed in the \ufb01rst half of the observed period, except for the period of global \ufb01nancial crisis, while the other half of the period has been mainly observed in Regime 2 or 4, with a comparatively longer duration in Regime 1. Consequently, Fig. 4 presents the empirical characteristics of a particular regime. 123 Annals of Operations Research Fig. 3 Market regimes detected Fig. 4 Descriptive statistics of regimes for MSCI World and BB EURO indices In Fig. 4, The empirical characteristics for Regime 1 summarise normal market situation. The switch to Regime 2 particularly worsen the characteristics of the stock market represented by MSCI. It could be seen that the mean return becomes negative, which is accompanied by increaseduncertaintyintermsofStDev,Range,andDrawdown.Comparatively,thelandscape of the bond market represented by EURO BB is not directly exposed to a short shock observed in the stock market. Similarly, the switch to Regime 3 resulted in a shock observed in the bond market, which is explained by a lower mean return and increased risk characteristics. In particular, the stress observed in the bond market slightly pushed stock prices up. Finally, Regime 4 represents a \ufb01nancial crisis observed in both the stock and bond markets. The black histogram represents the distribution of the historical data for each index. The colourful curve identi\ufb01es the normal probability distribution under each regime, respectively. 123 Annals of Operations Research Table 2 Probabilities of steady states \u03c0i, i = 1, . . . , 4 observed historically \u03c01 \u03c02 \u03c03 \u03c04 0.5772 0.1133 0.1082 0.2012 Once a certain regime is determined in the market, the performance results of the pension funds are conditioned by the regime, as outlined in Fig. 5. Here, each empirical distribu- tion obtained under a particular regime has been used to generate a conditional density bk j introduced in Sect. 2.1. The comparison of the plots given in Fig. 5 reveals that the largest variation in returns with heavy tails is observed under regime 4, as it was expected. Regime 3 distinguishes from the others by the smallest variation in general and, more interestingly, a differing central tendency including also spread around it among pension accumulation companies, especially for the birth-year groups covering 61\u201367 and 96\u201302. The evidence shows that comparatively large positive and negative returns are quite expected under Regime 2, with a heavier left tail. To check correlations between log-returns of funds in different regimes, please refer to Fig. 16. To check correlations between various performance measures in different regimes please refer to Fig. 15. 3.3 Stress simulation The matrix of transition probabilities of different regimes observed in the market was deter- mined over a historical period of 01/01/2007\u201313/09/2022. In particular, we obtain P = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239d 0.9829 0.0083 0.0079 0.0008 0.0479 0.9368 0 0.0153 0.0410 0.0023 0.9408 0.0159 0 0.0104 0.0091 0.9804 \u239e \u239f\u239f\u23a0 Consequently, the probabilities of steady states estimated from historical data are given in Table 2. Once transition probabilities have been found, we can check whether the sequence of regimes satis\ufb01es a Markovianity property by performing the \u03c72 test. In particular, with a test probability p-value=0.651 we conclude that the sequence follows the Markov property and we can proceed with steady states of the ergodic system (the hypothesis of irreducibility was not rejected). The mean First Passage Times (MFPT) of our identi\ufb01ed regimes are as follows. m = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239d 0.00 126.86 140.42 251.41 37.88 0.00 154.59 206.55 42.94 135.50 0.00 198.88 91.38 114.37 133.58 0.00 \u239e \u239f\u239f\u23a0. The elements of this matrix may be interpreted as average time necessary to reach column state from the row state, e.g., m12 = 126.9 means that being in no-crisis regime in 126.9 days the process will appear in stock market crisis regime and in m14 = 251.4 days global crisis is expected. Moreover, if currently there is global crisis one just need to wait for m41 = 91 days to get back to \"normal\" regime. The simulation of stress follows the methodology given in Sect. 2.2. The stress level k = 2, 3, 4, 10, 20 and 50 has selected for the demonstration purposes.

Graph representation of transition matrices under different stress levels are provided in Fig. 17. Transition matrices above are used to generate sequences of regime changes in the market that already have been presented in Fig. 4. Probabilities of steady states under different stress levels are provided in Table 3. Comparing the values given in Tables 3 and 2 we can see that the probability to appear in Regime 4 increases quite drastically as the stress level increases. Furthermore, when the stress level is above 10, then the Regime 4 is highly expected (\u03c0 > 0.9) and this state behaves like an absorbing state, that is, the global permanent \ufb01nancial crisis is observed in the market. Furthermore, from matrices of mean \ufb01rst passage times (MFPT) and duration of \ufb01nancial crisis (regime 4) it is possible to deduce what the stress level of a particular crisis is. For example, if k = 7, then 123 Annals of Operations Research Table 3 Probabilities of steady states \u03c0i, i = 1, . . . , 4 under different stress levels \u00d7k Stress level \u03c01 \u03c02 \u03c03 \u03c04 \u00d72 0.3253 0.1292 0.1202 0.4253 \u00d73 0.1990 0.1195 0.1092 0.5722 \u00d74 0.1319 0.1062 0.0958 0.6662 \u00d710 0.0280 0.0572 0.0499 0.8649 \u00d720 0.0076 0.0314 0.0269 0.9341 \u00d750 0.0013 0.0132 0.0112 0.9743 m\u00d77 = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239d 0 52.81 59.89 20.09 143.20 0 95.44 12.69 151.33 86.30 0 11.96 198.13 91.41 102.03 0 \u239e \u239f\u239f\u23a0. Assuming that a global \ufb01nancial crisis (regime 4) started on 31 January 2022 (earlier than Russia invaded Ukraine) and did not ended by December 2022 (did not switched to regime 1), which is exactly 198 working days or 9 months, we can deduce that stress level of this crisis is above 7, as m41 = 198.13. Moreover, if crisis will not end by 250 days (one year), then stress level will exceed 10. Similarly, we can estimate stress level of other crises in the past, e.g., \ufb01nancial crisis of 2008\u20132009 lasted for approx. Two years therefore stress level could exceed 25. 3.4 Strategy analysis In this subsection, strategies listed in Sect. 2.3 are veri\ufb01ed for pension funds of Swedbank. The pension accumulation company has been selected for the demonstration purposes because of two main reasons. First, Swedbank holds the largest share (40%) of the IInd pillar Lithuanian PF market. Second, the historical correlation of Swedbank funds with MCSI World and BB EURO indices is among the largest ones. The idea for simulation of regimes with different stress levels for other pension accumulation companies would be the same. 3.4.1 Case A: Swedbank keeps the strategy unchanged Suppose Swedbank does not change portfolio allocations in funds despite the stress level expected. Next \ufb01gures demonstrate the simulated trajectories of pension funds for 5 years ahead under different stress levels. From Figs. 7 and 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 in the Appendix we can see that the trend of the trajectories decreases as the stress level increases. This is not a surprise because probabilities of having more negative log-returns are much higher than of being positive. It is interesting to note that for all funds analysed, the trend remains positive if the stress level does not exceed 2. However, when stress level is above 3, the Swedbank funds tend to have negative cumulative log-returns. This statement is applied primarily to the most conservative funds (Swedbank 54\u201360 and Swedbank_T).

However, when stress level is above 3, the Swedbank funds tend to have negative cumulative log-returns. This statement is applied primarily to the most conservative funds (Swedbank 54\u201360 and Swedbank_T). In particular, the trend becomes negative for fund Swedbank 61\u201367 when stress level is above 10 and for funds Swedbank 68\u2013 74, Swedbank 89\u201395 and Swedbank 96\u201302 when stress level exceeds 50. Furthermore, the trend is always positive only in the case of two funds Swedbank 75\u201381 and Swedbank 82\u2013 88. These two funds could be treated as resilient to any stress. Additionaly, in the Appendix, 123 Annals of Operations Research Fig. 7 Simulated trajectories of cumulative log-returns of Swedbank 54\u201360 in case of strategy A Fig. 25 demonstrates the empirical densities of cumulative log-returns of Swedbank funds under different stress levels at time T = 1100. The statements above are supported by descriptive statistics of cumulative log-returns (see Table 4) at the end of the simulated period. From Fig. 4 we can deduce some important statements. First, the funds with lower share in equities sooner exhibit negative log-return. The standard deviation values show that a larger deviation is observed for the equity funds, which is quite expected. However, one can observe that the standard deviation within the same pension fund tends to increase when stress level doubles or triples, but its value becomes even lower compared to no stress for a severe stress level, i.e., not less than x10. Comparatively low values of skewness and kurtosis reveal the symmetric distribution of log-returns with no heavy-tails expected, which is observed in all cases. Risk measures such as VaR and CVaR indicate the expected loss, which becomes more severe with a higher stress level. In particular, for funds with larger share in equities, for example, birth-year groups ranging between 68\u201374 and 96\u201302, the loss in terms of VaR and CVaR is not expected. Finally, for cases where the Sharpe ratio is greater than 1, we could conclude that the risk was comparatively well managed, even some stress level was observed. This is not true for conservative funds, which demonstrate once again that investments in bonds only in the long term, with market crashes expected, would not ensure a positive return. 3.4.2 Case B: Swedbank changes its strategy to less conservative Here, we simulate regimes and change allocations of funds from their current to a little bit older group if crisis in stock markets is foretasted (regimes 2 or 4). From Figs. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32 and 33 we can see that the trend of trajectories decreases when the stress level increases. This is not a surprise because probabilities of having more negative log-returns are much higher than of being positive",

Down(side) and Up(side) deviations are calculated from target equal to 0 123 Annals of Operations Research negative and for the Swedbank 61\u201367 when the stress level is above 10. Differently from scenario A, the trend becomes negative for Swedbank 68\u201374 fund when stress level is 20. However, for the Swedbank 75\u201381, the trend becomes negative when the stress level reaches 50. Moreover, the trend is always positive only in case of three Swedbank funds 82\u201388, 89\u201395, and 96\u201302. These funds could be treated as resilient to any stress. The statements above are supported by statistics of cumulative log-returns (see Table 5) at the end of 1100 days (5 years) and histograms (Fig. 34). 3.4.3 Case C: Swedbank changes its strategy to very conservative Here, we simulate regimes and change allocations of funds from their current to oldest group if a crisis in stock markets is foretasted (regime 2 or 4). From Figs. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 42 we can see that the trend of trajectories decreases as the stress level increases. Similarly to scenarios A and B, the trend remains positive if the stress level does not exceed 2, when the stress level is above 3, then the trend of the most conservative funds (Swedbank 54\u201360 and Swedbank_T) becomes negative. Unlike scenarios A and B, the trend becomes negative for Swedbank funds 61\u201367, 68\u201374, 75\u201381, and 82\u201388 when the stress level is above 10. Furthermore, the trend becomes negative even for Swedbank 89\u201395 and 96\u201302 funds (at stress levels k \u226520). In the case of Scenario C, none of the funds could be treated as resilient. The statements above are supported by statistics of cumulative log-returns (see Table 6) at the end of 1100 days (5 years) and histograms (Fig. 43). 3.4.4 Comparison of Strategies A, B and C In this subsection, we show how the choice of strategy during the shock period in\ufb02uences the expected results (simulated) of Swedbank pension funds under different levels of stress. Figure8 shows the distributions of the returns of Swedbank pension funds. FromFig.8wecanclearlyseethat,independentlyofthebirth-yeargroupoftheparticipant, Strategies B and C allow us to reduce the volatility of the returns. However, expected returns also decrease with some exceptions. What is really surprising (counterintuitive) from this \ufb01gure is that for most of the funds, in case of small stress (k \u22643) or no stress at all, reallocation to a more conservative fund, during crisis periods, increased expectation. To better explain this issue and show the balance between expected return and variability after 5 years, in Fig. 9 the Sharpe ratio values are provided. Figure 9 allows us to compare the Sharpe ratio of simulated log-returns for Swedbank pension funds under different stress levels and different reaction Strategies A, B and C. We can clearly see that, depending on the stress level and birth-year group of the participant in the pension system, the Sharpe ratio varies much (from nearly 3 to nearly \u22125). For the oldest participants (Swedbank 54\u201360 and T), the Sharpe ratio does not depend on the choice of strategy, as the allocations are always the same. For these funds, performance is quite poor compared to other age groups (independently on stress level). Furthermore, if the stress level is higher than 2 (k > 2), then the Sharpe ratio becomes negative. Therefore, we can state that very conservative investments during stressed periods are not the best choices. Furthermore, the younger the participant, the better the performance of its pension fund can be observed, which is not surprising if there is no crisis in the market. However, in the face of crisis, performance starts to decrease along with an increasing level of stress. What is counterintuitive is that if pension fund reallocates investments to a little bit more 123 Annals of Operations Research Fig. 8 Box-plots of simulated log-returns of Swedbank funds under different stress levels (comparison of Strategies A, B and C) 123 Annals of Operations Research Fig. 9 Sharpe ratio of simulated Swedbank log-returns under different stress levels (comparison of Strategies A, B and C) conservative during stress periods (Strategies B and C), then the performance increases signi\ufb01cantly. Moreover, until some stress level (k \u226510) the performance can increase even if the allocations are switched to the most conservative level. Such behaviour can be explained in the following way: the variability of more conservative investment strategies is lower than that of less conservative funds, while the expectation is similar, and therefore the Sharpe ratio can increase. Furthermore, from Fig. 8 we have seen that when there is no stress or it is rather small (k \u22642) the expectation of Strategies B and C can be even higher than that of Strategy A (doing nothing during a crisis), which is why the greater Sharpe ratio in Strategies B and C is not so surprising. 123 Annals of Operations Research Fig. 10 Trade-off of mean comparing to Strategy A In further \ufb01gures (see Figs. 10, 11 and 12) the trade-off between different stress levels of three measures (mean, downside deviation (from 0) and Sharpe ratio) is shown when the pension fund manager switches investment from Strategy A to Strategy B and C. Figure 10 shows how the mean of cumulative log-returns changes when switching, under different stress levels, from existing allocations to more conservative funds is performed. It is dif\ufb01cult to generalise switching from A to B, as the trade-off is different for groups Swedbank 61\u201381 and Swedbank 82\u201302. For the \ufb01rst group, when the stress level is low (k = 0, 2, 3) the mean increases while in the case of higher stress (above 3) the mean decreases signi\ufb01cantly. For the second group, the mean remains stable or even increases independently on stress level. However, in case of switching from strategy A to C, the following generalisation could be made: if a stress level is low, then expectation can increase (even more than in previously mentioned case A to B), while for higher stress levels mean decreases drastically. Figure 11 shows how the downward (downside from 0) deviation of the cumulative log- returns changes when switching, under different stress levels, from existing allocations to more conservative funds is performed. Differently from the mean, a negative trade-off of downside deviation is desirable, while positive signals a poor performance of investment. It is interesting that for most of the funds the downside deviation decreases quite signi\ufb01cantly for small stress levels independently on strategies chosen, with an exception of Swedbank 75\u201395 in case A to B. Switching from A to B and from A to C mostly has different impact on trade-off (it is greater for A to C). Moreover, when a stress level increases the downside deviation can increase too, especially when k is above 20. A more clear trade-off is observed in the case of the Sharpe ratio (Fig. 12). Figure 12 shows how the Sharpe ratio of cumulative log-returns changes when switch- ing, under different stress levels, from existing allocations to more conservative funds is performed. In case of switching from A to B strategies, the Sharpe ratio decreases for more conservative funds when the stress level increases. However, for Swedbank 82\u201302, the Sharpe ratio remains stable or even increases (insigni\ufb01cantly) independently of the stress level. Fur- thermore, in case of switching from A to C when a stress level is low, the change of Sharpe 123 Annals of Operations Research Fig. 11 Trade-off of downside deviation (from 0) comparing to Strategy A Fig. 12 Trade-off of Sharpe ratio comparing to Strategy A ratio is positive, however, for higher stress levels the decline is very large, for all funds. Addi- tionally, in Appendix \ufb01gures of trade-off of standard deviation (Fig. 44) and CVaR (Fig. 45) could be found when switching from Strategy A to B and C is performed. In summary (from this Section) we can state that when a crisis with low stress level is expected, it is wise to switch to the most conservative funds (Strategy C), this temporary will increase performance of investments. However, if a crisis with high level of stress is expected, it is wise to reduce volatility a little bit only (Strategy B), and this will keep ef\ufb01ciency at a similar (or even higher) level. 123 Annals of Operations Research 4 Conclusion Recent evidence shows that the emerging \ufb01nancial crisis negatively affects the value of pen- sion fund assets worldwide",

Speci\ufb01cally, in the paper, we addressed the IInd-pillar life-cycle pension funds operating in Lithuania, with a particular interest on searching the answer, whether fund managers should stick to the life-cycle investment strategy despite of the dis- turbances and crisis that could be foreseen during the accumulation period; or maybe to diminish the share in equities during crashes in the market. As such, the analysis could be carried out by performing a stress testing, but unfortunately, this technique for the pension funds, taking into account their possible speci\ufb01c investment strategy, is not well-investigated in the literature. Therefore, under the assumption that investor\u2019s risk preferences and beliefs are primarily observed in main world indices and then transmitted to other markets such as pension funds, we propose a stress testing technique that includes a hidden Markov regime switching model and historical simulation for scenario generation. The sequence of regimes detected follows the Markovianity property. Furthermore, the highest probability is to appear in Regime 1 (there is no crisis of any type), while the prob- ability of large-scale crisis (Regime 4) is more than twice smaller. The interesting \ufb01nding from such type of analysis is that if there currently is no crisis (Regime 1) then one should expect large deviations in the stock markets in less than 127 working days. Furthermore, a large-scale crisis is expected after 252 days (which is equal to 1 year). According to our results, the \ufb01nancial crisis caused by the Russian\u2013Ukrainian war has already reached the stress level (at the end of 2022) k = 7. In this paper, three response strategies (A, B and C) to crisis are chosen. Strategy A rep- resents the passive (no) reaction of the pension fund manager. This strategy is used for a comparison. Strategy B is treated as a weak response to the crisis, as the fund manager only slightly reduces shares of volatile assets (less than 10%) in his portfolio. When the fund man- ager signi\ufb01cantly increases the share of conservative investments (to 90\u2013100 %), this reaction is denoted as strategy C (panic reaction). The list of strategies could be easily extended to better re\ufb02ect the potential options that fund managers have in the framework of regulation. According to the \ufb01ndings, it might come as a surprise that opting for Strategy C, which involves shifting to very conservative allocations, is advisable only when facing low stress levels (k \u22643). In such case, large-scale crises (Regime 4) are relatively brief, allowing a temporary shift to Strategy C to shield against immediate shocks without missing out on potential positive market corrections that follow. However, if the stress level is large, the best decision is either no reaction or only the weak reaction (strategy B). It is because the large- scale crisis takes longer time during which markets experience both signi\ufb01cant downturns and recoveries. Since the latest crisis has already reached a stress level above 5, it is wise to reduce volatility only a little and choose strategy B. Such a decision, for higher levels of stress, would sustain the investment\u2019s ef\ufb01ciency at a commendable level. The paper presents a general approach to stress testing using HMM. It could be easily applied to other pension funds as well as to different \ufb01nancial assets. It could be extended considering more regimes (states) if one wants to distinguish among different types of crisis. Similarly, more strategies can be considered if needed. However, this would probably need a deeper analysis of the reasons of the crises, which was not the goal of this paper. Finally, for the future research, one could consider non-homogenous Hiden Markov model with time- dependent transition probabilities. However, such probabilities would be dif\ufb01cult to estimate, some additional assumptions would be needed. Moreover, the stressed transition probabilities would need to be de\ufb01ned in a different way. 123 Annals of Operations Research A Appendices SeetheFigs.13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 and Tables 5, 6.
